Raw model response:
I'm going to try to solve this puzzle. Let's see what we have here.

So, there are training examples with inputs and outputs. The inputs and outputs are lists of lists of numbers, kind of like matrices. Each row in the input corresponds to a row in the output.

Looking at the first training example:

INPUT:

- Row 1: All 1's

- Row 2: All 1's

- Row 3: Two 1's followed by all 4's

- Row 4: Two 1's, then 4,3,2,1,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7

- And so on...

OUTPUT:

- Similar structure, but some rows are modified.

Comparing input and output, it seems like the first few rows remain the same, and in some rows, the zeros are replaced with a repeating sequence.

Looking closer, it appears that in the input, there are some rows with zeros, and in the output, those zeros are replaced with a repeating pattern of numbers.

For example, in the first training example, row 14 in input has some zeros, and in output, those zeros are replaced with 5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...

Similarly, in row 15, zeros are replaced with 7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...

It seems like the replacement pattern is a cycle of numbers: 1,3,5,7,2,4,6,...

Wait, looking at the numbers, it seems like they are cycling through odd numbers first, then even numbers.

Wait, 1,3,5,7 are odd, then 2,4,6 are even.

But 9 is missing in some places.

Wait, in the test input, I see 9's appearing.

Wait, perhaps it's cycling through numbers 1,3,5,7,9.

Wait, in the first training example, the cycle is 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.

Wait, perhaps it's cycling through numbers in a specific order, and when it hits zero, it continues the cycle.

Wait, maybe it's treating zero as a placeholder to continue the sequence.

Looking back, in the first training example, row 14 input has zeros, and output has 5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...

Similarly, row 15 input has zeros, and output has 7,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...

It seems like the sequence continues from where the previous number left off.

Wait, perhaps it's a repeating sequence of 1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...

Wait, but in some places, 9 is included.

Wait, in the test input, 9 is present.

Wait, perhaps it's 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,...

But in the first training example, 8 is not present.

Wait, in example 2, 9 is present.

Wait, maybe it's cycling through odd numbers first, then even numbers.

So, 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,...

In the first training example, it's 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.

In example 2, it goes up to 9.

In the test input, it goes up to 9.

So, perhaps the cycle is 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8.

But in the first training example, 8 is not present.

Wait, perhaps it's cycling through numbers in a specific order defined by the initial rows.

Wait, in the first row where the cycle starts, it has numbers like 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.

Wait, perhaps the cycle is defined by the unique numbers in the matrix, excluding zeros.

Wait, maybe it's the unique numbers sorted in some order.

Wait, in the first training example, the cycle is 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.

In example 2, it's 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8.

In the test input, it's 1,3,5,7,9.

So, perhaps the cycle is all the unique non-zero numbers in the matrix, sorted in ascending order.

Wait, in the first training example, unique numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, but it's cycled as 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.

Wait, that's not sorted ascending order.

Wait, perhaps it's sorted by odd then even.

Yes, 1,3,5,7 are odd, then 2,4,6 are even.

In example 2, numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, cycled as 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8.

Yes, odd numbers first in ascending order, then even numbers in ascending order.

In the test input, numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,7,9, cycled as 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6.

Wait, 6 is not in the test input.

Wait, in row 9 of the test input, there is a 9.

Wait, but in row 14, there is a 7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,...

Wait, but 6 is present in row 14 of the test input.

Wait, no, in row 14, it's 1,0,0,0,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3.

Wait, 6 is not present in row 14.

Wait, in row 15: 1,0,0,0,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5.

No 6 here.

Wait, in row 16: 0,0,0,0,0,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7.

No 6 here.

Wait, in row 17: 0,0,0,0,0,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9.

No 6.

Row 18: 0,0,0,0,0,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1.

No 6.

Row 19: 0,0,0,0,0,9,1,3,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5.

Here, 9 and 1 and 3 and 5, but no 6.

Wait, but in row 20: 0,0,0,0,0,1,3,5,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5.

Here, 1,3,5,7,9.

Row 21: 0,0,0,0,0,3,5,7,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7.

Again, 1,3,5,7,9.

Row 22: 0,0,0,0,0,5,7,9,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9.

Still, 1,3,5,7,9.

Row 23: 1,1,4,3,5,7,9,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1.

Again, 1,3,5,7,9.

Row 24: 1,1,4,5,7,9,1,3,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5.

1,3,5,7,9.

Row 25: 1,1,4,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5.

1,3,5,7,9.

Row 26: 1,1,4,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7.

1,3,5,7,9.

Row 27: 1,1,4,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9.

1,3,5,7,9.

Row 28: 1,1,4,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1.

1,3,5,7,9.

So, in the test input, the cycle seems to be 1,3,5,7,9.

Wait, but in the first training example, it was 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.

Wait, perhaps the cycle is defined by the unique non-zero numbers sorted in ascending order, separated into odd and even.

So, in the first training example, unique non-zero numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

Odds: 1,3,5,7

Evens: 2,4,6

So, cycle is 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.

In example 2, unique non-zero numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

Odds: 1,3,5,7,9

Evens: 2,4,6,8

So, cycle is 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8.

In the test input, unique non-zero numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,7,9.

Odds: 1,3,5,7,9

Evens: 2,4

So, cycle should be 1,3,5,7,9,2,4.

But in the test input, it seems to be cycling through 1,3,5,7,9.

Wait, but in row 14 of test input, it's 1,0,0,0,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3.

So, it's cycling through 1,3,5,7,9.

Wait, but according to the rule I thought, it should be 1,3,5,7,9,2,4.

But in the test input, it's only cycling through 1,3,5,7,9.

Wait, maybe the cycle is based on the numbers present in that particular row.

Wait, but in row 14, there are 1,7,9.

But it's cycling through 1,3,5,7,9.

So, perhaps it's always cycling through all possible odd numbers first in ascending order, then even numbers in ascending order, regardless of their presence in the row.

Wait, but in row 14 of test input, 3 and 5 are not present, but they are included in the cycle.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the cycle is all unique odd numbers in ascending order, followed by all unique even numbers in ascending order.

In the first training example, odds:1,3,5,7 and evens:2,4,6.

In example 2, odds:1,3,5,7,9 and evens:2,4,6,8.

In test input, odds:1,3,5,7,9 and evens:2,4.

So, the cycle is 1,3,5,7,9,2,4.

But in the test input, in row 14, it's cycling through 1,3,5,7,9.

Wait, but 2 and 4 are present in the matrix, so why not include them in the cycle?

Wait, perhaps the cycle includes all numbers from 1 to the highest number present, including both odds and evens.

Wait, but in the first training example, numbers are up to 7.

In example 2, up to 9.

In test input, up to 9.

Wait, perhaps it's cycling through numbers 1 to 9, in order:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

But that doesn't match the observed cycles.

Wait, in the first training example, cycle is 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.

Which is odds first, then evens.

In example 2, 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8.

Again, odds first in ascending order, then evens in ascending order.

In test input, seems to be 1,3,5,7,9,2,4.

Yes, same pattern.

So, the cycle is all odd numbers in ascending order, followed by all even numbers in ascending order.

Then, in the matrix, wherever there is a zero, it's replaced by the next number in the cycle, wrapping around if necessary.

Looking back at the first training example, row 14 input has zeros, and output has 5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...

The cycle is 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.

Starting from 5, next is 7, then 2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...

So, it continues the cycle from where it left off.

Similarly, in row 15, input has zeros, and output has 7,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...

Cycle is 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.

Starting from 7, next is 2, but wait, output shows 7,1,3,5,7,...

Hmm, maybe I need to rethink this.

Wait, perhaps the cycle starts from the last non-zero number in the row.

In row 14 of the first training example, the last non-zero number before zeros is 7.

Then, the next number in the cycle should be 2, but in the output, it's 5.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it starts from the first non-zero number in the row.

In row 14, the first non-zero numbers are 1,1,4,3,2,1, then zeros.

Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's based on the global cycle, not per row.

Wait, maybe there's a global cycle defined by the unique numbers in the entire matrix.

Wait, but in the first training example, unique numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

Odds:1,3,5,7

Evens:2,4,6

Cycle:1,3,5,7,2,4,6

Similarly, in example 2, cycle is 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8.

In test input, cycle should be 1,3,5,7,9,2,4.

Now, in the first training example, row 14 input:

1,1,4,7,2,4,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6

Output:

1,1,4,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6

So, the zeros are replaced with 1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,...

Similarly, row 15 input:

1,1,4,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1

Output:

1,1,4,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1

No zeros to replace.

Wait, perhaps only the zeros are replaced with the cycle, and the rest remains the same.

Looking back, in row 14 of the first training example, zeros are replaced with 1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,...

Which is the cycle.

Similarly, in row 15, no zeros, so no change.

In row 16:

1,1,4,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1

Output:

1,1,4,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3

So, zeros are replaced with 1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,...

Again, the cycle.

So, the rule seems to be:

- Determine the cycle: all unique odd numbers in ascending order, followed by all unique even numbers in ascending order.

- For each row, replace zeros with the next numbers in the cycle, wrapping around if necessary.

- The cycle should be repeated as many times as needed to fill all zeros in the row.

Now, in the test input, unique numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,7,9.

Odds:1,3,5,7,9

Evens:2,4

So, the cycle is 1,3,5,7,9,2,4.

Now, let's apply this to the test input.

Looking at row 14 of the test input:

1,1,4,3,5,7,9,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1

We need to replace the zeros with 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,1,3,5,7,9,2,4,...

Starting from the first zero, replace with 1, then 3, then 5, and so on.

So, the zeros are replaced with 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,1.

Wait, but there are 7 zeros.

So, 1,3,5,7,9,2,4.

So, the output for this row should be:

1,1,4,3,5,7,9,1,3,1,3,5,7,9,2,4,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1

Wait, but in the output, it should be:

1,1,4,3,5,7,9,1,3,1,3,5,7,9,2,4,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1

Wait, but in the test input, the output should be similar to the training output, where zeros are replaced with the cycle.

Similarly, for other rows with zeros.

So, to summarize, the solution is to:

- Identify all unique non-zero numbers in the matrix.

- Separate them into odd and even numbers.

- Sort the odd numbers in ascending order, then the even numbers in ascending order, to form a cycle.

- For each row, replace zeros with the next numbers in the cycle, repeating the cycle as necessary.

- Keep non-zero numbers as they are.

Now, for the test input, unique non-zero numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,7,9.

Odds:1,3,5,7,9

Evens:2,4

Cycle:1,3,5,7,9,2,4

Now, go through each row of the test input and replace zeros with this cycle.

For example, row 12:

0,0,0,0,0,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7

Output should be:

1,3,5,7,9,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7

Wait, but the first five zeros should be replaced with 1,3,5,7,9.

So, the output row should be:

1,3,5,7,9,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7

Similarly, for row 13:

0,0,0,0,0,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9

Output:

1,3,5,7,9,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9

And so on.

For rows without zeros, keep them as they are.

So, the final output should be the test input with zeros replaced by the cycle 1,3,5,7,9,2,4 repeated as necessary in each row.

I think that's the pattern.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or transformation in the training examples that maps the input to the output and then apply that pattern to the test input to generate the final output.

### Approach
1. **Identify the Cycle:**
   - Determine the unique non-zero numbers in the entire matrix.
   - Separate these numbers into odd and even categories.
   - Sort the odd numbers in ascending order, followed by the even numbers in ascending order to form a cycle.

2. **Replace Zeros:**
   - For each row in the input matrix, replace the zeros with the next numbers from the cycle, repeating the cycle as necessary.

3. **Keep Non-Zero Elements Unchanged:**
   - Non-zero elements in each row should remain as they are in the output.

### Solution Code
```python
def solve_puzzle(input_matrix):
    # Flatten the matrix to find unique non-zero numbers
    flat_list = [num for row in input_matrix for num in row if num != 0]
    unique_numbers = sorted(set(flat_list))
    
    # Separate odds and evens
    odds = [num for num in unique_numbers if num % 2 != 0]
    evens = [num for num in unique_numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    
    # Create the cycle: odds first, then evens
    cycle = odds + evens
    
    # Function to replace zeros in a row using the cycle
    def replace_zeros(row, cycle):
        cycle_iter = cycle
        output_row = []
        for num in row:
            if num == 0:
                # Replace zero with the next number in the cycle
                next_num = cycle_iter.pop(0)
                output_row.append(next_num)
                # Append the used number back to maintain the cycle
                cycle_iter.append(next_num)
            else:
                output_row.append(num)
        return output_row
    
    # Apply the replacement to each row
    output_matrix = [replace_zeros(row, cycle.copy()) for row in input_matrix]
    
    return output_matrix

response:', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})], 'next_step': 'generate', 'current_response': "I'm going to try to solve this puzzle. Let's see what we have here.\n\nSo, there are training examples with inputs and outputs. The inputs and outputs are lists of lists of numbers, kind of like matrices. Each row in the input corresponds to a row in the output.\n\nLooking at the first training example:\n\nINPUT:\n\n- Row 1: All 1's\n\n- Row 2: All 1's\n\n- Row 3: Two 1's followed by all 4's\n\n- Row 4: Two 1's, then 4,3,2,1,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7\n\n- And so on...\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n- Similar structure, but some rows are modified.\n\nComparing input and output, it seems like the first few rows remain the same, and in some rows, the zeros are replaced with a repeating sequence.\n\nLooking closer, it appears that in the input, there are some rows with zeros, and in the output, those zeros are replaced with a repeating pattern of numbers.\n\nFor example, in the first training example, row 14 in input has some zeros, and in output, those zeros are replaced with 5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...\n\nSimilarly, in row 15, zeros are replaced with 7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...\n\nIt seems like the replacement pattern is a cycle of numbers: 1,3,5,7,2,4,6,...\n\nWait, looking at the numbers, it seems like they are cycling through odd numbers first, then even numbers.\n\nWait, 1,3,5,7 are odd, then 2,4,6 are even.\n\nBut 9 is missing in some places.\n\nWait, in the test input, I see 9's appearing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's cycling through numbers 1,3,5,7,9.\n\nWait, in the first training example, the cycle is 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.\n\nWait, perhaps it's cycling through numbers in a specific order, and when it hits zero, it continues the cycle.\n\nWait, maybe it's treating zero as a placeholder to continue the sequence.\n\nLooking back, in the first training example, row 14 input has zeros, and output has 5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...\n\nSimilarly, row 15 input has zeros, and output has 7,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...\n\nIt seems like the sequence continues from where the previous number left off.\n\nWait, perhaps it's a repeating sequence of 1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...\n\nWait, but in some places, 9 is included.\n\nWait, in the test input, 9 is present.\n\nWait, perhaps it's 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,...\n\nBut in the first training example, 8 is not present.\n\nWait, in example 2, 9 is present.\n\nWait, maybe it's cycling through odd numbers first, then even numbers.\n\nSo, 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8,...\n\nIn the first training example, it's 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.\n\nIn example 2, it goes up to 9.\n\nIn the test input, it goes up to 9.\n\nSo, perhaps the cycle is 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8.\n\nBut in the first training example, 8 is not present.\n\nWait, perhaps it's cycling through numbers in a specific order defined by the initial rows.\n\nWait, in the first row where the cycle starts, it has numbers like 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.\n\nWait, perhaps the cycle is defined by the unique numbers in the matrix, excluding zeros.\n\nWait, maybe it's the unique numbers sorted in some order.\n\nWait, in the first training example, the cycle is 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.\n\nIn example 2, it's 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8.\n\nIn the test input, it's 1,3,5,7,9.\n\nSo, perhaps the cycle is all the unique non-zero numbers in the matrix, sorted in ascending order.\n\nWait, in the first training example, unique numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, but it's cycled as 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.\n\nWait, that's not sorted ascending order.\n\nWait, perhaps it's sorted by odd then even.\n\nYes, 1,3,5,7 are odd, then 2,4,6 are even.\n\nIn example 2, numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, cycled as 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8.\n\nYes, odd numbers first in ascending order, then even numbers in ascending order.\n\nIn the test input, numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,7,9, cycled as 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6.\n\nWait, 6 is not in the test input.\n\nWait, in row 9 of the test input, there is a 9.\n\nWait, but in row 14, there is a 7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,...\n\nWait, but 6 is present in row 14 of the test input.\n\nWait, no, in row 14, it's

1,1,4,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7.\n\n1,3,5,7,9.\n\nRow 27: 1,1,4,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9.\n\n1,3,5,7,9.\n\nRow 28:

1,3,5,7,2,4,6.\n\nWait, perhaps the cycle is defined by the unique non-zero numbers sorted in ascending order, separated into odd and even.\n\nSo, in the first training example, unique non-zero numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nOdds: 1,3,5,7\n\nEvens: 2,4,6\n\nSo, cycle is 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.\n\nIn example 2, unique non-zero numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nOdds: 1,3,5,7,9\n\nEvens: 2,4,6,8\n\nSo, cycle is 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8.\n\nIn the test input, unique non-zero numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,7,9.\n\nOdds: 1,3,5,7,9\n\nEvens: 2,4\n\nSo, cycle should be 1,3,5,7,9,2,4.\n\nBut in the test input, it seems to be cycling through 1,3,5,7,9.\n\nWait, but in row 14 of test input, it's 1,0,0,0,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3.\n\nSo, it's cycling through 1,3,5,7,9.\n\nWait, but according to the rule I thought, it should be 1,3,5,7,9,2,4.\n\nBut in the test input, it's only cycling through 1,3,5,7,9.\n\nWait, maybe the cycle is based on the numbers present in that particular row.\n\nWait, but in row 14, there are 1,7,9.\n\nBut it's cycling through 1,3,5,7,9.\n\nSo, perhaps it's always cycling through all possible odd numbers first in ascending order, then even numbers in ascending order, regardless of their presence in the row.\n\nWait, but in row 14 of test input, 3 and 5 are not present, but they are included in the cycle.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the cycle is all unique odd numbers in ascending order, followed by all unique even numbers in ascending order.\n\nIn the first training example, odds:1,3,5,7 and evens:2,4,6.\n\nIn example 2, odds:1,3,5,7,9 and evens:2,4,6,8.\n\nIn test input, odds:1,3,5,7,9 and evens:2,4.\n\nSo, the cycle is 1,3,5,7,9,2,4.\n\nBut in the test input, in row 14, it's cycling through 1,3,5,7,9.\n\nWait, but 2 and 4 are present in the matrix, so why not include them in the cycle?\n\nWait, perhaps the cycle includes all numbers from 1 to the highest number present, including both odds and evens.\n\nWait, but in the first training example, numbers are up to 7.\n\nIn example 2, up to 9.\n\nIn test input, up to 9.\n\nWait, perhaps it's cycling through numbers 1 to 9, in order:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nBut that doesn't match the observed cycles.\n\nWait, in the first training example, cycle is 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.\n\nWhich is odds first, then evens.\n\nIn example 2, 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8.\n\nAgain, odds first in ascending order, then evens in ascending order.\n\nIn test input, seems to be 1,3,5,7,9,2,4.\n\nYes, same pattern.\n\nSo, the cycle is all odd numbers in ascending order, followed by all even numbers in ascending order.\n\nThen, in the matrix, wherever there is a zero, it's replaced by the next number in the cycle, wrapping around if necessary.\n\nLooking back at the first training example, row 14 input has zeros, and output has 5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...\n\nThe cycle is 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.\n\nStarting from 5, next is 7, then 2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...\n\nSo, it continues the cycle from where it left off.\n\nSimilarly, in row 15, input has zeros, and output has 7,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,...\n\nCycle is 1,3,5,7,2,4,6.\n\nStarting from 7, next is 2, but wait, output shows 7,1,3,5,7,...\n\nHmm, maybe I need to rethink this.\n\nWait, perhaps the cycle starts from the last non-zero number in the row.\n\nIn row 14 of the first training example, the last non-zero number before zeros is 7.\n\nThen, the next number in the cycle should be 2, but in the output, it's 5.\n\nWait, that doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe it starts from the first non-zero number in the row.\n\nIn row 14, the first non-zero numbers are 1,1,4,3,2,1, then zeros.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps it's based on the global cycle, not per row.\n\nWait, maybe there's a global cycle defined by the unique numbers in the entire matrix.\n\nWait, but in the first training example, unique numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nOdds:1,3,5,7\n\nEvens:2,4,6\n\nCycle:1,3,5,7,2,4,6\n\nSimilarly, in example 2, cycle is 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8.\n\nIn test input, cycle should be 1,3,5,7,9,2,4.\n\nNow, in the first training example, row 14 input:\n\n1,1,4,7,2,4,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6\n\nOutput:\n\n1,1,4,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6\n\nSo, the zeros are replaced with 1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,...\n\nSimilarly, row 15 input:\n\n1,1,4,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1\n\nOutput:\n\n1,1,4,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1\n\nNo zeros to replace.\n\nWait, perhaps only the zeros are replaced with the cycle, and the rest remains the same.\n\nLooking back, in row 14 of the first training example, zeros are replaced with 1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,...\n\nWhich is the cycle.\n\nSimilarly, in row 15, no zeros, so no change.\n\nIn row 16:\n\n1,1,4,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,0,0,0,0,0,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1\n\nOutput:\n\n1,1,4,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3\n\nSo, zeros are replaced with 1,3,5,7,2,4,6,1,3,...\n\nAgain, the cycle.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be:\n\n- Determine the cycle: all unique odd numbers in ascending order, followed by all unique even numbers in ascending order.\n\n- For each row, replace zeros with the next numbers in the cycle, wrapping around if necessary.\n\n- The cycle should be repeated as many times as needed to fill all zeros in the row.\n\nNow, in the test input, unique numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,7,9.\n\nOdds:1,3,5,7,9\n\nEvens:2,4\n\nSo, the cycle is 1,3,5,7,9,2,4.\n\nNow, let's apply this to the test input.\n\nLooking at row 14 of the test input:\n\n1,1,4,3,5,7,9,1,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1\n\nWe need to replace the zeros with 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,1,3,5,7,9,2,4,...\n\nStarting from the first zero, replace with 1, then 3, then 5, and so on.\n\nSo, the zeros are replaced with 1,3,5,7,9,2,4,1.\n\nWait, but there are 7 zeros.\n\nSo, 1,3,5,7,9,2,4.\n\nSo, the output for this row should be:\n\n1,1,4,3,5,7,9,1,3,1,3,5,7,9,2,4,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1\n\nWait, but in the output, it should be:\n\n1,1,4,3,5,7,9,1,3,1,3,5,7,9,2,4,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1\n\nWait, but in the test input, the output should be similar to the training output, where zeros are replaced with the cycle.\n\nSimilarly, for other rows with zeros.\n\nSo, to summarize, the solution is to:\n\n- Identify all unique non-zero numbers in the matrix.\n\n- Separate them into odd and even numbers.\n\n- Sort the odd numbers in ascending order, then the even numbers in ascending order, to form a cycle.\n\n- For each row, replace zeros with the next numbers in the cycle, repeating the cycle as necessary.\n\n- Keep non-zero numbers as they are.\n\nNow, for the test input, unique non-zero numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,7,9.\n\nOdds:1,3,5,7,9\n\nEvens:2,4\n\nCycle:1,3,5,7,9,2,4\n\nNow, go through each row of the test input and replace zeros with this cycle.\n\nFor example, row 12:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7\n\nOutput should be:\n\n1,3,5,7,9,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7\n\nWait, but the first five zeros should be replaced with 1,3,5,7,9.\n\nSo, the output row should be:\n\n1,3,5,7,9,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7\n\nSimilarly, for row 13:\n\n0,0,0,0,0,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9\n\nOutput:\n\n1,3,5,7,9,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9,1,3,5,7,9\n\nAnd so on.\n\nFor rows without zeros, keep them as they are.\n\nSo, the final output should be the test input with zeros replaced by the cycle 1,3,5,7,9,2,4 repeated as necessary in each row.\n\nI think that's the pattern.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or transformation in the training examples that maps the input to the output and then apply that pattern to the test input to generate the final output.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Cycle:**\n   - Determine the unique non-zero numbers in the entire matrix.\n   - Separate these numbers into odd and even categories.\n   - Sort the odd numbers in ascending order, followed by the even numbers in ascending order to form a cycle.\n\n2. **Replace Zeros:**\n   - For each row in the input matrix, replace the zeros with the next numbers from the cycle, repeating the cycle as necessary.\n\n3. **Keep Non-Zero Elements Unchanged:**\n   - Non-zero elements in each row should remain as they are in the output.\n\n### Solution
