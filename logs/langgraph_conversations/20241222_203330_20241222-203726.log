Raw model response:
Alright, I've got this puzzle to solve. Let's see what's going on here. There are some training examples provided, each with an input and an output. My task is to figure out the pattern or transformation that turns the input into the output and then apply that same pattern to the test input.

First, I need to understand what's in these inputs and outputs. Looking at the first training example:

INPUT:

A big grid of numbers, mostly zeros, with some twos, fours, threes, and eights in specific patterns.

OUTPUT:

A smaller grid that seems to be a compressed version of the input, focusing on certain areas.

Hmm, it looks like the output is extracting specific regions from the input grid and arranging them in a smaller grid.

Let me look at the second training example to see if this holds.

INPUT:

Again, a big grid with ones, twos, fours, and eights in specific patterns.

OUTPUT:

A smaller grid that appears to be composed of the non-zero regions from the input.

Wait, in both cases, the output seems to be taking the non-zero blocks from the input and arranging them in a grid.

Let me check the third training example.

INPUT:

A larger grid with zeros, ones, twos, threes, fours, and eights.

OUTPUT:

A smaller grid that again seems to be composed of the non-zero blocks from the input.

Okay, this seems consistent. It looks like the task is to identify the non-zero contiguous blocks in the input grid and arrange them into a smaller grid in the output.

But I need to be more precise. Let's examine the first training example in detail.

In the first training example, the input has:

- A block of twos in the top rows.

- A block of fours next to it.

- A block of threes below them.

- A block of eights at the bottom.

The output arranges these blocks into a 2x2 grid:

- Top-left: twos

- Top-right: fours

- Bottom-left: twos

- Bottom-right: fours

Wait, but looking closely, it's not exactly 2x2; it's 4 rows by 8 columns.

Wait, perhaps it's arranging the blocks row-wise.

Wait, maybe it's about extracting the non-zero blocks row by row and placing them side by side.

Let me try to visualize this.

In the first input, the twos and fours are in the top rows, side by side. Then threes and eights below them.

In the output, the twos and fours are in the first four rows, side by side, and then threes and eights below them.

Wait, but in the output, it's arranged in a way that the twos and fours are in the first four rows, with twos in the first four columns and fours in the next four columns.

Then, in the next four rows, it's twos and fours again, but with some zeros in between.

Wait, perhaps it's about taking the non-zero columns from the input and arranging them into a smaller grid.

Wait, perhaps it's about removing the zero columns and zero rows.

But no, because in the output, there are zeros present within the blocks.

Wait, maybe it's about cropping the input grid to the bounding box of the non-zero elements.

But that doesn't seem to be the case, because in the output, there are multiple separate blocks arranged together.

Wait, maybe it's about tiling the non-zero blocks into a grid.

Looking back at the first training example:

The input has:

- A block of twos and fours in the top rows.

- A block of threes below them.

- A block of eights at the bottom.

The output arranges twos and fours in the first four rows, and threes and eights in the next four rows.

So, perhaps it's about separating the input into horizontal strips of non-zero blocks and then arranging them in the output.

Wait, perhaps it's about dividing the input grid into rows of blocks and then arranging those blocks into a smaller grid.

Alternatively, maybe it's about taking the non-zero subgrids and arranging them in reading order.

Wait, maybe it's about extracting the non-zero submatrices and arranging them in the order they appear.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me think about the dimensions.

In the first training example:

- Input is 18x17.

- Output is 8x8.

In the second training example:

- Input is 20x22.

- Output is 8x12.

In the third training example:

- Input is 25x22.

- Output is 12x18.

Hmm, no clear relationship in dimensions.

Wait, in the first training example, the output is 8x8, which is two blocks of 4x4 each.

In the second training example, the output is 8x12, which could be four blocks of 4x4 each.

In the third training example, the output is 12x18, which could be six blocks of 4x6 each.

Wait, but in the third training example, the output has 4 rows and 18 columns, but it's arranged in 3 rows and 6 columns of blocks.

This is getting confusing.

Let me try another approach.

Looking at the first training example:

The input has:

- A block of twos, 5 rows high and 5 columns wide.

- A block of fours, 5 rows high and 4 columns wide.

- A block of threes, 4 rows high and 4 columns wide.

- A block of eights, 4 rows high and 4 columns wide.

The output arranges these blocks into a 4x8 grid, with twos and fours on top, and threes and eights below.

It seems like it's arranging the blocks in the order they appear from top to bottom and left to right.

Similarly, in the second training example, it's arranging the blocks of ones, twos, and fours into the output grid.

In the third training example, it's arranging blocks of ones, twos, threes, and eights.

So, perhaps the general pattern is:

1. Identify the non-overlapping blocks of non-zero values in the input grid.

2. Arrange these blocks into an output grid in the order they appear in the input grid.

But I need to define what a "block" is.

In the input grids, the non-zero values seem to be grouped into rectangular blocks separated by zero rows and columns.

So, maybe the task is to extract these rectangular blocks and arrange them into a smaller grid, preserving their relative positions.

Wait, but in the output, they seem to be arranged in a compact form, without the zero rows and columns in between.

Let me try to formalize this.

Step 1: Identify the bounding boxes of non-zero regions in the input grid.

Step 2: Extract these bounding boxes as subgrids.

Step 3: Arrange these subgrids into an output grid in the order they appear in the input grid.

But I need to define "order they appear in the input grid." Probably top-to-bottom, left-to-right.

Let me try applying this to the first training example.

First, identify the non-zero blocks:

- Block of twos: rows 1-5, columns 1-5

- Block of fours: rows 1-5, columns 9-12

- Block of threes: rows 9-12, columns 6-9

- Block of eights: rows 15-18, columns 10-13

Then, extract these subgrids:

- Twos: 5x5

- Fours: 5x4

- Threes: 4x4

- Eights: 4x4

Then, arrange them into an output grid.

In the first training example's output, it seems that twos and fours are combined into the first four rows, and threes and eights into the next four rows.

Wait, but twos and fours are both in the top part of the input, while threes and eights are below.

So, perhaps it's about combining the blocks horizontally first, then vertically.

Wait, perhaps it's about arranging the blocks in reading order, left to right, top to bottom.

But I need a consistent rule that applies to all training examples.

Looking back at the first training example's output:

It's 4 rows by 8 columns.

The first four columns correspond to the twos block, and the next four columns correspond to the fours block.

Then, the next four rows correspond to the threes and eights blocks.

So, it's arranging the blocks side by side horizontally, then stacking them vertically.

Wait, but the twos block is 5 rows high, and in the output, it's only 4 rows.

Wait, in the first training example's output, the twos and fours are each 4 rows high, even though in the input, they are 5 rows high.

That suggests that the output is taking the last 4 rows of each block.

Wait, but looking at the output, it seems to be taking rows 2 to 5 of the twos block and rows 2 to 5 of the fours block, and arranging them side by side.

Then, in the next four rows, it's taking the threes and eights blocks entirely, as they are 4 rows high.

Wait, but this seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps it's about taking the last 4 rows of each horizontal strip.

Wait, maybe the output is composed of 4-row panels, taking the content from the input grid.

In the first training example, the first 5 rows have twos and fours side by side.

So, take rows 2 to 5 (rows 1 to 5, but excluding the first row perhaps).

Then, the next 4 rows have threes and eights.

Wait, perhaps it's about dividing the input grid into 4-row panels and extracting the non-zero parts.

But this doesn't seem consistent across all training examples.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about taking the non-zero subgrids of size 4x4 and arranging them.

But in the first training example, the twos block is 5x5, not 4x4.

Wait, maybe it's about dividing each non-zero block into 4x4 subblocks and arranging those.

But in the first training example, the twos block is 5x5, which would result in two 4x4 subblocks.

Wait, perhaps it's about tiling each non-zero block into 4x4 subblocks, overlapping if necessary.

But I need to verify this with the training examples.

Looking at the first training example:

Twos block: 5x5

If I divide it into two 4x4 subblocks: one covering rows 1-4, columns 1-4, and another covering rows 2-5, columns 2-5.

Then, similarly for the fours block: 5x4, divided into two 4x4 subblocks.

Then, for the threes and eights, which are 4x4, just take them as is.

Then, arrange these subblocks in the output grid.

But this seems complicated, and I need to see if this matches the output.

Looking at the output, it seems like it's taking the last 4 rows of the twos and fours blocks and arranging them side by side.

Wait, in the first training example's output, the first four rows correspond to rows 2 to 5 of the twos and fours blocks.

Then, the next four rows correspond to the threes and eights blocks entirely.

This might be a pattern.

Similarly, in the second training example, the output has:

- The ones block: 4x4

- The twos block: 4x4

- The threes block: 4x4

- The fours block: 4x4

Arranged in a 8x12 grid.

Wait, 8 rows and 12 columns, which could be two blocks side by side.

Wait, perhaps the output grid has a fixed size of 4 rows per block vertically and extends horizontally.

But in the third training example, the output is 12x18, which could be three blocks vertically and three horizontally.

This is getting too vague.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that each output grid has rows that are composed by concatenating the corresponding rows of the extracted blocks.

For example, in the first training example:

- Rows 1-4 of the output are composed by concatenating rows 1-4 of the twos block and rows 1-4 of the fours block.

- Rows 5-8 of the output are composed by concatenating rows 1-4 of the threes block and rows 1-4 of the eights block.

This seems to match the output.

Similarly, in the second training example:

- Rows 1-4 of the output are concatenations of the ones and twos blocks.

- Rows 5-8 are concatenations of the threes and fours blocks.

In the third training example:

- Rows 1-4 are concatenations of the fours and threes blocks.

- Rows 5-8 are concatenations of the twos and ones blocks.

Wait, but in the third training example, the output has 12 rows, which suggests three blocks vertically.

Wait, perhaps each output row corresponds to a row in the input, but only including the non-zero blocks.

Wait, perhaps it's about removing the zero rows and arranging the remaining rows into the output grid.

But in the first training example, the input has zero rows between the blocks, which are removed in the output.

But in the output, there are four rows for each set of blocks.

Wait, maybe it's about selecting every four rows from the non-zero rows.

But that doesn't seem consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about selecting the rows that have non-zero elements and arranging them into the output grid, with some padding.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps the task is to identify groups of rows that contain non-zero elements and arrange them into the output grid.

In the first training example, rows 1-5 have non-zero elements in the first and fifth rows.

Rows 6-8 are all zero.

Rows 9-12 have non-zero elements.

Rows 13-14 are zero.

Rows 15-18 have non-zero elements.

So, there are three groups of non-zero rows.

Each group is then divided into subblocks horizontally.

Wait, perhaps it's about dividing the input grid into strips of four rows and then extracting the non-zero blocks within each strip.

But in the first training example, the first strip has rows 1-4, which contain twos and fours.

Then rows 5-8 contain threes and eights.

But in the output, it's arranging rows 2-5 and rows 9-12.

This is too confusing.

I need to look for a different pattern.

Looking at the test input:

It has blocks of threes, twos, fours, and ones, with eights in between.

I need to apply whatever pattern I deduce from the training examples to this test input.

Perhaps I should consider that the output grid has a fixed height of 4 rows per block, and the width extends based on the number of blocks.

But I need to confirm this with the training examples.

In the first training example, there are two blocks side by side (twos and fours), each 4 columns wide, resulting in an 8-column output.

In the second training example, there are four blocks side by side, resulting in a 12-column output.

In the third training example, there are six blocks side by side, resulting in an 18-column output.

Wait, but in the third training example, the output is 12x18, which could be three blocks vertically and six horizontally.

Wait, I'm getting lost here.

Maybe I should consider that each non-zero block in the input corresponds to a 4x4 subblock in the output.

But in the first training example, the twos block is 5x5, which would require two 4x4 subblocks, overlapping.

Similarly, the fours block is 5x4, which would require two 4x4 subblocks.

Then, the threes and eights are 4x4, so one each.

Then, in the output, arrange these subblocks in the order they appear in the input.

So, in the first training example's output:

- First four columns: twos subblock 1

- Columns 5-8: fours subblock 1

- Rows 5-8: twos subblock 2 and fours subblock 2

- Then threes and eights subblocks.

But looking at the actual output, it seems more straightforward.

Wait, maybe it's about taking the non-zero columns and arranging them into a grid without the zero columns in between.

In the first training example, the non-zero columns are columns 1-5, 9-12, 15-18.

In the output, these are arranged side by side.

Wait, but in the output, it's not exactly the non-zero columns; it's the non-zero blocks arranged in a specific way.

This is tricky.

I need to think differently.

Perhaps the task is to extract the non-zero subgrids and arrange them into a single grid without the zero rows and columns in between.

But in the training examples, the output grids have zero elements within them, so it's not just removing zeros entirely.

Wait, maybe it's about tiling the non-zero blocks into the output grid, preserving their relative positions.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that each output row corresponds to a row in the input, but only including the non-zero columns.

In the first training example, the non-zero columns are 1-5,9-12,15-18.

So, in the output, columns 1-4 correspond to input columns 1-4, columns 5-8 correspond to input columns 9-12, etc.

This seems to match the output.

Similarly, in the second training example, the non-zero columns are spread out, and in the output, they are brought together.

In the third training example, the same approach seems to hold.

So, perhaps the general rule is:

- Identify the non-zero columns in the input grid.

- Arrange these columns into the output grid in their original order, removing any zero columns in between.

- The output grid has as many rows as the maximum number of non-zero rows in any column group.

Wait, but in the first training example, the output has four rows, even though some blocks have five rows.

Wait, perhaps it's taking the last four rows of each block.

But in the first training example, the twos block has five rows, and in the output, it's represented by four rows, presumably rows 2 to 5 of the twos block.

Similarly, the fours block is rows 1-5, and in the output, rows 1-4.

Wait, perhaps it's excluding the first row of each block.

But in the threes and eights blocks, which have four rows, they are included entirely in the output.

This is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about selecting rows that have non-zero elements in any of the non-zero columns.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

Step 1: Identify the non-zero columns in the input grid.

Step 2: For each group of consecutive non-zero columns, treat them as a block.

Step 3: Arrange these blocks side by side in the output grid.

Step 4: For each row in the output grid, collect the values from the corresponding rows in each block.

This seems plausible.

Let's apply this to the first training example.

Identify non-zero columns: 1-5,9-12,15-18.

These are three blocks: columns 1-5,9-12,15-18.

Then, arrange these blocks side by side in the output grid.

But in the output, it's arranged as twos and fours on top, and threes and eights below.

Wait, perhaps it's about grouping the column blocks by their row groups.

Wait, maybe it's about dividing the input grid into row strips with non-zero columns and arranging them accordingly.

This is getting too complicated.

I need to find a different strategy.

Perhaps it's about extracting the non-zero submatrices and arranging them into a grid based on their positions.

Wait, maybe it's similar to tiling or concatenating matrices.

In the first training example, the output is essentially the twos and fours blocks concatenated horizontally, followed by the threes and eights blocks concatenated horizontally, but adjusted to have the same number of rows.

Wait, in the output, each subblock is adjusted to have four rows.

In the twos block, which has five rows, perhaps the first row is ignored, and rows 2-5 are taken.

Similarly for the fours block.

Then, the threes and eights blocks have four rows, so they are taken as is.

Then, these are arranged side by side in the output grid.

This seems consistent.

Similarly, in the second training example, the output arranges the ones, twos, threes, and fours blocks, adjusting their rows to four rows each.

In the third training example, it's arranging the fours, threes, twos, and ones blocks accordingly.

So, the general pattern seems to be:

- Identify the non-zero blocks in the input grid.

- For each block, extract the last four rows.

- Arrange these extracted blocks side by side in the output grid, preserving their horizontal and vertical order.

This seems to match the training examples.

Let me verify this with the first training example.

- Twos block: rows 2-5

- Fours block: rows 2-5

- Threes block: rows 1-4

- Eights block: rows 1-4

Then, arrange twos and fours side by side, then threes and eights side by side, in the output grid.

This matches the output.

Similarly, in the second training example:

- Ones block: rows 1-4

- Twos block: rows 1-4

- Threes block: rows 1-4

- Fours block: rows 1-4

Arrange ones and twos side by side, then threes and fours side by side.

In the third training example:

- Fours block: rows 1-4

- Threes block: rows 1-4

- Twos block: rows 1-4

- Ones block: rows 1-4

Arrange them accordingly.

So, the rule is:

- For each non-zero block in the input grid, extract the last four rows.

- Arrange these extracted blocks side by side in the order they appear from left to right and top to bottom.

Now, apply this to the test input.

First, identify the non-zero blocks in the test input.

Looking at the test input:

- Rows 1-2: zeros

- Row 3: columns 4-7 have threes

- Row 4: columns 4,6 have threes

- Row 5: columns 4-7 have threes

- Row 6: zeros

- Row 7: columns 7-10 have twos

- Row 8: columns 7,9 have twos

- Row 9: columns 7-10 have twos

- Row 10: columns 7-10 have twos

- Rows 11-12: zeros

- Row 13: columns 13-16 have fours

- Row 14: columns 13-16 have fours

- Row 15: columns 13-16 have fours

- Row 16: columns 13-16 have fours

- Row 17: columns 13-16 have fours

- Row 18: columns 13-16 have ones

- Row 19: columns 13,15 have ones

- Row 20: columns 13,15 have ones

- Row 21: columns 13-16 have ones

- Rows 22-23: zeros

So, the non-zero blocks are:

- Threes: rows 3-5, columns 4-7

- Twos: rows 7-10, columns 7-10

- Fours: rows 13-17, columns 13-16

- Ones: rows 18-21, columns 13-16

Now, for each block, extract the last four rows.

- Threes block: rows 2-5 (since rows 3-5 are non-zero, but we need four rows, so take rows 2-5, which are rows 4-5 with some zeros above)

Wait, need to be careful.

The threes block is in rows 3-5, so to get four rows, we need to include row 2 (which is zero) and rows 3-5.

But according to our rule, we take the last four rows of each block.

So, for the threes block (rows 3-5), the last four rows would be rows 2-5 (since there are only three non-zero rows, pad with zeros above).

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my rule.

Maybe for blocks with fewer than four rows, pad with zeros above to make it four rows.

Similarly, for blocks with more than four rows, take the last four rows.

In this case:

- Threes block: rows 3-5 (three rows), so in the output, pad with one zero row at the top.

- Twos block: rows 7-10 (four rows), so take rows 7-10 as is.

- Fours block: rows 13-17 (five rows), so take rows 14-17.

- Ones block: rows 18-21 (four rows), so take rows 18-21 as is.

Then, arrange these extracted blocks side by side in the order they appear: threes, twos, fours, ones.

So, the output grid would have:

- Four rows for each extracted block.

- Columns arranged side by side for each block.

Therefore, the output grid would have four rows and columns corresponding to the widths of the extracted blocks.

The threes block is 3 columns wide (columns 4-6), but since we're taking four rows, we need to decide on the column extent.

Wait, perhaps I need to define the block's column extent based on the non-zero columns.

For the threes block: columns 4-7.

For the twos block: columns 7-10.

For the fours block: columns 13-16.

For the ones block: columns 13-16.

Now, extract the last four rows for each block:

- Threes block: rows 3-5 (only three rows), so pad with one zero row at the top.

- Twos block: rows 7-10 (four rows).

- Fours block: rows 14-17 (last four rows).

- Ones block: rows 18-21 (four rows).

Then, arrange these extracted blocks side by side in the output grid.

So, the output grid would have:

- Four rows.

- Columns: first four columns for threes block (columns 4-7 of input).

- Next four columns for twos block (columns 7-10 of input).

- Next four columns for fours block (columns 13-16 of input).

- Next four columns for ones block (columns 13-16 of input).

Wait, but the fours and ones blocks are in the same columns, so their columns overlap.

Hmm, perhaps in such cases, I need to arrange them sequentially, even if they overlap in the input.

Alternatively, maybe I need to arrange the blocks based on their column ranges without considering overlaps.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps I should treat each block as a separate entity and arrange them side by side in the order they appear from left to right and top to bottom.

So, in the output grid:

- Columns 1-4: threes block (padded with one zero row at the top).

- Columns 5-8: twos block.

- Columns 9-12: fours block.

- Columns 13-16: ones block.

But in the input, the fours and ones blocks are in the same columns, so in the output, they will be in separate columns.

This might not be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps overlapping blocks in columns should be merged in the output.

But that seems unclear.

I need to make a decision and proceed.

Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with arranging the blocks side by side in the order they appear, padding or truncating to four rows as necessary.

So, for the threes block: rows 2-5 (rows 3-5 with non-zero values, row 2 is zero), columns 4-7.

For the twos block: rows 7-10, columns 7-10.

For the fours block: rows 14-17, columns 13-16.

For the ones block: rows 18-21, columns 13-16.

Then, in the output grid:

- Rows 1-4: threes block (with one zero row at the top), columns 1-4.

- Rows 1-4: twos block, columns 5-8.

- Rows 1-4: fours block, columns 9-12.

- Rows 1-4: ones block, columns 13-16.

So, the output grid would be 4 rows by 16 columns.

But in the training examples, the output grids have different dimensions, so perhaps the number of columns is adjustable based on the number of blocks.

Wait, in the first training example, there were two blocks side by side, resulting in 8 columns.

In the second training example, there were four blocks side by side, resulting in 12 columns.

In the third training example, there were six blocks side by side, resulting in 18 columns.

So, perhaps each block contributes a number of columns equal to the width of the block.

In this case, the threes block is 4 columns wide (columns 4-7), the twos block is 4 columns wide (columns 7-10), the fours block is 4 columns wide (columns 13-16), and the ones block is 4 columns wide (columns 13-16).

Wait, but columns 7-10 for twos and columns 13-16 for fours and ones.

So, in the output, it would be:

- Columns 1-4: threes block (columns 4-7 of input).

- Columns 5-8: twos block (columns 7-10 of input).

- Columns 9-12: fours block (columns 13-16 of input).

- Columns 13-16: ones block (columns 13-16 of input).

So, overall, 16 columns.

Now, construct the output grid row by row.

Row 1:

- Columns 1-4: threes block, row 2 (since row 1 is zero): [0,0,0,0]

- Columns 5-8: twos block, row 7: [0,0,2,2]

- Columns 9-12: fours block, row 14: [0,0,4,4]

- Columns 13-16: ones block, row 18: [0,0,1,1]

So, row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,4,4,0,0,1,1]

Row 2:

- Columns 1-4: threes block, row 3: [3,3,3,3]

- Columns 5-8: twos block, row 8: [0,0,2,2]

- Columns 9-12: fours block, row 15: [4,4,4,4]

- Columns 13-16: ones block, row 19: [0,0,1,1]

So, row 2: [3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,0,0,1,1]

Row 3:

- Columns 1-4: threes block, row 4: [3,0,0,3]

- Columns 5-8: twos block, row 9: [0,0,2,2]

- Columns 9-12: fours block, row 16: [4,4,4,4]

- Columns 13-16: ones block, row 20: [0,0,1,1]

So, row 3: [3,0,0,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,0,0,1,1]

Row 4:

- Columns 1-4: threes block, row 5: [3,3,3,3]

- Columns 5-8: twos block, row 10: [0,0,2,2]

- Columns 9-12: fours block, row 17: [4,4,4,4]

- Columns 13-16: ones block, row 21: [1,1,1,1]

So, row 4: [3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1]

Therefore, the output grid should be:

[[0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,4,4,0,0,1,1],

 [3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,0,0,1,1],

 [3,0,0,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,0,0,1,1],

 [3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1]]

But wait, in the ones block, row 18 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],

so columns 13-16 have [1,1,1,1].

Similarly, row 19 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0],

so columns 13-16 have [1,1,0,0].

Row 20 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0],

so columns 13-16 have [1,1,0,0].

Row 21 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],

so columns 13-16 have [1,1,1,1].

Therefore, the ones block is:

Row 18: [1,1,1,1]

Row 19: [1,1,0,0]

Row 20: [1,1,0,0]

Row 21: [1,1,1,1]

So, in the output grid, the ones block contributes these rows to columns 13-16.

Similarly, the fours block is:

Row 14: [4,4,4,4]

Row 15: [4,4,4,4]

Row 16: [4,4,4,4]

Row 17: [4,4,4,4]

So, in the output grid, columns 9-12 have these values.

Therefore, the output grid should be:

Row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,4,4,1,1,1,1]

Row 2: [3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,1,1,0,0]

Row 3: [3,0,0,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,1,1,0,0]

Row 4: [3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1]

Wait, but in row 1, the ones block is row 18, which has [1,1,1,1].

Similarly for other rows.

So, the output grid is 4 rows by 16 columns.

But in the training examples, the output grids have different numbers of columns, depending on the number of blocks.

In the first training example, there were two blocks side by side, resulting in 8 columns.

In the second training example, there were four blocks side by side, resulting in 12 columns.

In the third training example, there were six blocks side by side, resulting in 18 columns.

So, it seems that the number of columns in the output grid is determined by the number of blocks extracted from the input grid.

In this test input, there are four blocks: threes, twos,

response_metadata={})], 'next_step': 'generate', 'current_response': 'Alright, I\'ve got this puzzle to solve. Let\'s see what\'s going on here. There are some training examples provided, each with an input and an output. My task is to figure out the pattern or transformation that turns the input into the output and then apply that same pattern to the test input.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what\'s in these inputs and outputs. Looking at the first training example:\n\nINPUT:\n\nA big grid of numbers, mostly zeros, with some twos, fours, threes, and eights in specific patterns.\n\nOUTPUT:\n\nA smaller grid that seems to be a compressed version of the input, focusing on certain areas.\n\nHmm, it looks like the output is extracting specific regions from the input grid and arranging them in a smaller grid.\n\nLet me look at the second training example to see if this holds.\n\nINPUT:\n\nAgain, a big grid with ones, twos, fours, and eights in specific patterns.\n\nOUTPUT:\n\nA smaller grid that appears to be composed of the non-zero regions from the input.\n\nWait, in both cases, the output seems to be taking the non-zero blocks from the input and arranging them in a grid.\n\nLet me check the third training example.\n\nINPUT:\n\nA larger grid with zeros, ones, twos, threes, fours, and eights.\n\nOUTPUT:\n\nA smaller grid that again seems to be composed of the non-zero blocks from the input.\n\nOkay, this seems consistent. It looks like the task is to identify the non-zero contiguous blocks in the input grid and arrange them into a smaller grid in the output.\n\nBut I need to be more precise. Let\'s examine the first training example in detail.\n\nIn the first training example, the input has:\n\n- A block of twos in the top rows.\n\n- A block of fours next to it.\n\n- A block of threes below them.\n\n- A block of eights at the bottom.\n\nThe output arranges these blocks into a 2x2 grid:\n\n- Top-left: twos\n\n- Top-right: fours\n\n- Bottom-left: twos\n\n- Bottom-right: fours\n\nWait, but looking closely, it\'s not exactly 2x2; it\'s 4 rows by 8 columns.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s arranging the blocks row-wise.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s about extracting the non-zero blocks row by row and placing them side by side.\n\nLet me try to visualize this.\n\nIn the first input, the twos and fours are in the top rows, side by side. Then threes and eights below them.\n\nIn the output, the twos and fours are in the first four rows, side by side, and then threes and eights below them.\n\nWait, but in the output, it\'s arranged in a way that the twos and fours are in the first four rows, with twos in the first four columns and fours in the next four columns.\n\nThen, in the next four rows, it\'s twos and fours again, but with some zeros in between.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s about taking the non-zero columns from the input and arranging them into a smaller grid.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s about removing the zero columns and zero rows.\n\nBut no, because in the output, there are zeros present within the blocks.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s about cropping the input grid to the bounding box of the non-zero elements.\n\nBut that doesn\'t seem to be the case, because in the output, there are multiple separate blocks arranged together.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s about tiling the non-zero blocks into a grid.\n\nLooking back at the first training example:\n\nThe input has:\n\n- A block of twos and fours in the top rows.\n\n- A block of threes below them.\n\n- A block of eights at the bottom.\n\nThe output arranges twos and fours in the first four rows, and threes and eights in the next four rows.\n\nSo, perhaps it\'s about separating the input into horizontal strips of non-zero blocks and then arranging them in the output.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s about dividing the input grid into rows of blocks and then arranging those blocks into a smaller grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it\'s about taking the non-zero subgrids and arranging them in reading order.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s about extracting the non-zero submatrices and arranging them in the order they appear.\n\nBut I need a more concrete approach.\n\nLet me think about the dimensions.\n\nIn the first training example:\n\n- Input is 18x17.\n\n- Output is 8x8.\n\nIn the second training example:\n\n- Input is 20x22.\n\n- Output is 8x12.\n\nIn the third training example:\n\n- Input is 25x22.\n\n- Output is 12x18.\n\nHmm, no clear relationship in dimensions.\n\nWait, in the first training example, the output is 8x8, which is two blocks of 4x4 each.\n\nIn the second training example, the output is 8x12, which could be four blocks of 4x4 each.\n\nIn the third training example, the output is 12x18, which could be six blocks of 4x6 each.\n\nWait, but in the third training example, the output has 4 rows and 18 columns, but it\'s arranged in 3 rows and 6 columns of blocks.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the first training example:\n\nThe input has:\n\n- A block of twos, 5 rows high and 5 columns wide.\n\n- A block of fours, 5 rows high and 4 columns wide.\n\n- A block of threes, 4 rows high and 4 columns wide.\n\n- A block of eights, 4 rows high and 4 columns wide.\n\nThe output arranges these blocks into a 4x8 grid, with twos and fours on top, and threes and eights below.\n\nIt seems like it\'s arranging the blocks in the order they appear from top to bottom and left to right.\n\nSimilarly, in the second training example, it\'s arranging the blocks of ones, twos, and fours into the output grid.\n\nIn the third training example, it\'s arranging blocks of ones, twos, threes, and eights.\n\nSo, perhaps the general pattern is:\n\n1. Identify the non-overlapping blocks of non-zero values in the input grid.\n\n2. Arrange these blocks into an output grid in the order they appear in the input grid.\n\nBut I need to define what a "block" is.\n\nIn the input grids, the non-zero values seem to be grouped into rectangular blocks separated by zero rows and columns.\n\nSo, maybe the task is to extract these rectangular blocks and arrange them into a smaller grid, preserving their relative positions.\n\nWait, but in the output, they seem to be arranged in a compact form, without the zero rows and columns in between.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nStep 1: Identify the bounding boxes of non-zero regions in the input grid.\n\nStep 2: Extract these bounding boxes as subgrids.\n\nStep 3: Arrange these subgrids into an output grid in the order they appear in the input grid.\n\nBut I need to define "order they appear in the input grid." Probably top-to-bottom, left-to-right.\n\nLet me try applying this to the first training example.\n\nFirst, identify the non-zero blocks:\n\n- Block of twos: rows 1-5, columns 1-5\n\n- Block of fours: rows 1-5, columns 9-12\n\n- Block of threes: rows 9-12, columns 6-9\n\n- Block of eights: rows 15-18, columns 10-13\n\nThen, extract these subgrids:\n\n- Twos: 5x5\n\n- Fours: 5x4\n\n- Threes: 4x4\n\n- Eights: 4x4\n\nThen, arrange them into an output grid.\n\nIn the first training example\'s output, it seems that twos and fours are combined into the first four rows, and threes and eights into the next four rows.\n\nWait, but twos and fours are both in the top part of the input, while threes and eights are below.\n\nSo, perhaps it\'s about combining the blocks horizontally first, then vertically.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s about arranging the blocks in reading order, left to right, top to bottom.\n\nBut I need a consistent rule that applies to all training examples.\n\nLooking back at the first training example\'s output:\n\nIt\'s 4 rows by 8 columns.\n\nThe first four columns correspond to the twos block, and the next four columns correspond to the fours block.\n\nThen, the next four rows correspond to the threes and eights blocks.\n\nSo, it\'s arranging the blocks side by side horizontally, then stacking them vertically.\n\nWait, but the twos block is 5 rows high, and in the output, it\'s only 4 rows.\n\nWait, in the first training example\'s output, the twos and fours are each 4 rows high, even though in the input, they are 5 rows high.\n\nThat suggests that the output is taking the last 4 rows of each block.\n\nWait, but looking at the output, it seems to be taking rows 2 to 5 of the twos block and rows 2 to 5 of the fours block, and arranging them side by side.\n\nThen, in the next four rows, it\'s taking the threes and eights blocks entirely, as they are 4 rows high.\n\nWait, but this seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s about taking the last 4 rows of each horizontal strip.\n\nWait, maybe the output is composed of 4-row panels, taking the content from the input grid.\n\nIn the first training example, the first 5 rows have twos and fours side by side.\n\nSo, take rows 2 to 5 (rows 1 to 5, but excluding the first row perhaps).\n\nThen, the next 4 rows have threes and eights.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s about dividing the input grid into 4-row panels and extracting the non-zero parts.\n\nBut this doesn\'t seem consistent across all training examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s about taking the non-zero subgrids of size 4x4 and arranging them.\n\nBut in the first training example, the twos block is 5x5, not 4x4.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s about dividing each non-zero block into 4x4 subblocks and arranging those.\n\nBut in the first training example, the twos block is 5x5, which would result in two 4x4 subblocks.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s about tiling each non-zero block into 4x4 subblocks, overlapping if necessary.\n\nBut I need to verify this with the training examples.\n\nLooking at the first training example:\n\nTwos block: 5x5\n\nIf I divide it into two 4x4 subblocks: one covering rows 1-4, columns 1-4, and another covering rows 2-5, columns 2-5.\n\nThen, similarly for the fours block: 5x4, divided into two 4x4 subblocks.\n\nThen, for the threes and eights, which are 4x4, just take them as is.\n\nThen, arrange these subblocks in the output grid.\n\nBut this seems complicated, and I need to see if this matches the output.\n\nLooking at the output, it seems like it\'s taking the last 4 rows of the twos and fours blocks and arranging them side by side.\n\nWait, in the first training example\'s output, the first four rows correspond to rows 2 to 5 of the twos and fours blocks.\n\nThen, the next four rows correspond to the threes and eights blocks entirely.\n\nThis might be a pattern.\n\nSimilarly, in the second training example, the output has:\n\n- The ones block: 4x4\n\n- The twos block: 4x4\n\n- The threes block: 4x4\n\n- The fours block: 4x4\n\nArranged in a 8x12 grid.\n\nWait, 8 rows and 12 columns, which could be two blocks side by side.\n\nWait, perhaps the output grid has a fixed size of 4 rows per block vertically and extends horizontally.\n\nBut in the third training example, the output is 12x18, which could be three blocks vertically and three horizontally.\n\nThis is getting too vague.\n\nI need a better approach.\n\nLet me consider that each output grid has rows that are composed by concatenating the corresponding rows of the extracted blocks.\n\nFor example, in the first training example:\n\n- Rows 1-4 of the output are composed by concatenating rows 1-4 of the twos block and rows 1-4 of the fours block.\n\n- Rows 5-8 of the output are composed by concatenating rows 1-4 of the threes block and rows 1-4 of the eights block.\n\nThis seems to match the output.\n\nSimilarly, in the second training example:\n\n- Rows 1-4 of the output are concatenations of the ones and twos blocks.\n\n- Rows 5-8 are concatenations of the threes and fours blocks.\n\nIn the third training example:\n\n- Rows 1-4 are concatenations of the fours and threes blocks.\n\n- Rows 5-8 are concatenations of the twos and ones blocks.\n\nWait, but in the third training example, the output has 12 rows, which suggests three blocks vertically.\n\nWait, perhaps each output row corresponds to a row in the input, but only including the non-zero blocks.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s about removing the zero rows and arranging the remaining rows into the output grid.\n\nBut in the first training example, the input has zero rows between the blocks, which are removed in the output.\n\nBut in the output, there are four rows for each set of blocks.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s about selecting every four rows from the non-zero rows.\n\nBut that doesn\'t seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s about selecting the rows that have non-zero elements and arranging them into the output grid, with some padding.\n\nThis is getting too convoluted.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the task is to identify groups of rows that contain non-zero elements and arrange them into the output grid.\n\nIn the first training example, rows 1-5 have non-zero elements in the first and fifth rows.\n\nRows 6-8 are all zero.\n\nRows 9-12 have non-zero elements.\n\nRows 13-14 are zero.\n\nRows 15-18 have non-zero elements.\n\nSo, there are three groups of non-zero rows.\n\nEach group is then divided into subblocks horizontally.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s about dividing the input grid into strips of four rows and then extracting the non-zero blocks within each strip.\n\nBut in the first training example, the first strip has rows 1-4, which contain twos and fours.\n\nThen rows 5-8 contain threes and eights.\n\nBut in the output, it\'s arranging rows 2-5 and rows 9-12.\n\nThis is too confusing.\n\nI need to look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nIt has blocks of threes, twos, fours, and ones, with eights in between.\n\nI need to apply whatever pattern I deduce from the training examples to this test input.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that the output grid has a fixed height of 4 rows per block, and the width extends based on the number of blocks.\n\nBut I need to confirm this with the training examples.\n\nIn the first training example, there are two blocks side by side (twos and fours), each 4 columns wide, resulting in an 8-column output.\n\nIn the second training example, there are four blocks side by side, resulting in a 12-column output.\n\nIn the third training example, there are six blocks side by side, resulting in an 18-column output.\n\nWait, but in the third training example, the output is 12x18, which could be three blocks vertically and six horizontally.\n\nWait, I\'m getting lost here.\n\nMaybe I should consider that each non-zero block in the input corresponds to a 4x4 subblock in the output.\n\nBut in the first training example, the twos block is 5x5, which would require two 4x4 subblocks, overlapping.\n\nSimilarly, the fours block is 5x4, which would require two 4x4 subblocks.\n\nThen, the threes and eights are 4x4, so one each.\n\nThen, in the output, arrange these subblocks in the order they appear in the input.\n\nSo, in the first training example\'s output:\n\n- First four columns: twos subblock 1\n\n- Columns 5-8: fours subblock 1\n\n- Rows 5-8: twos subblock 2 and fours subblock 2\n\n- Then threes and eights subblocks.\n\nBut looking at the actual output, it seems more straightforward.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s about taking the non-zero columns and arranging them into a grid without the zero columns in between.\n\nIn the first training example, the non-zero columns are columns 1-5, 9-12, 15-18.\n\nIn the output, these are arranged side by side.\n\nWait, but in the output, it\'s not exactly the non-zero columns; it\'s the non-zero blocks arranged in a specific way.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nI need to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the task is to extract the non-zero subgrids and arrange them into a single grid without the zero rows and columns in between.\n\nBut in the training examples, the output grids have zero elements within them, so it\'s not just removing zeros entirely.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s about tiling the non-zero blocks into the output grid, preserving their relative positions.\n\nBut I need a systematic way to do this.\n\nLet me consider that each output row corresponds to a row in the input, but only including the non-zero columns.\n\nIn the first training example, the non-zero columns are 1-5,9-12,15-18.\n\nSo, in the output, columns 1-4 correspond to input columns 1-4, columns 5-8 correspond to input columns 9-12, etc.\n\nThis seems to match the output.\n\nSimilarly, in the second training example, the non-zero columns are spread out, and in the output, they are brought together.\n\nIn the third training example, the same approach seems to hold.\n\nSo, perhaps the general rule is:\n\n- Identify the non-zero columns in the input grid.\n\n- Arrange these columns into the output grid in their original order, removing any zero columns in between.\n\n- The output grid has as many rows as the maximum number of non-zero rows in any column group.\n\nWait, but in the first training example, the output has four rows, even though some blocks have five rows.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s taking the last four rows of each block.\n\nBut in the first training example, the twos block has five rows, and in the output, it\'s represented by four rows, presumably rows 2 to 5 of the twos block.\n\nSimilarly, the fours block is rows 1-5, and in the output, rows 1-4.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s excluding the first row of each block.\n\nBut in the threes and eights blocks, which have four rows, they are included entirely in the output.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s about selecting rows that have non-zero elements in any of the non-zero columns.\n\nBut I need a more concrete approach.\n\nLet me try to implement this step by step.\n\nStep 1: Identify the non-zero columns in the input grid.\n\nStep 2: For each group of consecutive non-zero columns, treat them as a block.\n\nStep 3: Arrange these blocks side by side in the output grid.\n\nStep 4: For each row in the output grid, collect the values from the corresponding rows in each block.\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nLet\'s apply this to the first training example.\n\nIdentify non-zero columns: 1-5,9-12,15-18.\n\nThese are three blocks: columns 1-5,9-12,15-18.\n\nThen, arrange these blocks side by side in the output grid.\n\nBut in the output, it\'s arranged as twos and fours on top, and threes and eights below.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s about grouping the column blocks by their row groups.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s about dividing the input grid into row strips with non-zero columns and arranging them accordingly.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nI need to find a different strategy.\n\nPerhaps it\'s about extracting the non-zero submatrices and arranging them into a grid based on their positions.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s similar to tiling or concatenating matrices.\n\nIn the first training example, the output is essentially the twos and fours blocks concatenated horizontally, followed by the threes and eights blocks concatenated horizontally, but adjusted to have the same number of rows.\n\nWait, in the output, each subblock is adjusted to have four rows.\n\nIn the twos block, which has five rows, perhaps the first row is ignored, and rows 2-5 are taken.\n\nSimilarly for the fours block.\n\nThen, the threes and eights blocks have four rows, so they are taken as is.\n\nThen, these are arranged side by side in the output grid.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nSimilarly, in the second training example, the output arranges the ones, twos, threes, and fours blocks, adjusting their rows to four rows each.\n\nIn the third training example, it\'s arranging the fours, threes, twos, and ones blocks accordingly.\n\nSo, the general pattern seems to be:\n\n- Identify the non-zero blocks in the input grid.\n\n- For each block, extract the last four rows.\n\n- Arrange these extracted blocks side by side in the output grid, preserving their horizontal and vertical order.\n\nThis seems to match the training examples.\n\nLet me verify this with the first training example.\n\n- Twos block: rows 2-5\n\n- Fours block: rows 2-5\n\n- Threes block: rows 1-4\n\n- Eights block: rows 1-4\n\nThen, arrange twos and fours side by side, then threes and eights side by side, in the output grid.\n\nThis matches the output.\n\nSimilarly, in the second training example:\n\n- Ones block: rows 1-4\n\n- Twos block: rows 1-4\n\n- Threes block: rows 1-4\n\n- Fours block: rows 1-4\n\nArrange ones and twos side by side, then threes and fours side by side.\n\nIn the third training example:\n\n- Fours block: rows 1-4\n\n- Threes block: rows 1-4\n\n- Twos block: rows 1-4\n\n- Ones block: rows 1-4\n\nArrange them accordingly.\n\nSo, the rule is:\n\n- For each non-zero block in the input grid, extract the last four rows.\n\n- Arrange these extracted blocks side by side in the order they appear from left to right and top to bottom.\n\nNow, apply this to the test input.\n\nFirst, identify the non-zero blocks in the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n- Rows 1-2: zeros\n\n- Row 3: columns 4-7 have threes\n\n- Row 4: columns 4,6 have threes\n\n- Row 5: columns 4-7 have threes\n\n- Row 6: zeros\n\n- Row 7: columns 7-10 have twos\n\n- Row 8: columns 7,9 have twos\n\n- Row 9: columns 7-10 have twos\n\n- Row 10: columns 7-10 have twos\n\n- Rows 11-12: zeros\n\n- Row 13: columns 13-16 have fours\n\n- Row 14: columns 13-16 have fours\n\n- Row 15: columns 13-16 have fours\n\n- Row 16: columns 13-16 have fours\n\n- Row 17: columns 13-16 have fours\n\n- Row 18: columns 13-16 have ones\n\n- Row 19: columns 13,15 have ones\n\n- Row 20: columns 13,15 have ones\n\n- Row 21: columns 13-16 have ones\n\n- Rows 22-23: zeros\n\nSo, the non-zero blocks are:\n\n- Threes: rows 3-5, columns 4-7\n\n- Twos: rows 7-10, columns 7-10\n\n- Fours: rows 13-17, columns 13-16\n\n- Ones: rows 18-21, columns 13-16\n\nNow, for each block, extract the last four rows.\n\n- Threes block: rows 2-5 (since rows 3-5 are non-zero, but we need four rows, so take rows 2-5, which are rows 4-5 with some zeros above)\n\nWait, need to be careful.\n\nThe threes block is in rows 3-5, so to get four rows, we need to include row 2 (which is zero) and rows 3-5.\n\nBut according to our rule, we take the last four rows of each block.\n\nSo, for the threes block (rows 3-5), the last four rows would be rows 2-5 (since there are only three non-zero rows, pad with zeros above).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust my rule.\n\nMaybe for blocks with fewer than four rows, pad with zeros above to make it four rows.\n\nSimilarly, for blocks with more than four rows, take the last four rows.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- Threes block: rows 3-5 (three rows), so in the output, pad with one zero row at the top.\n\n- Twos block: rows 7-10 (four rows), so take rows 7-10 as is.\n\n- Fours block: rows 13-17 (five rows), so take rows 14-17.\n\n- Ones block: rows 18-21 (four rows), so take rows 18-21 as is.\n\nThen, arrange these extracted blocks side by side in the order they appear: threes, twos, fours, ones.\n\nSo, the output grid would have:\n\n- Four rows for each extracted block.\n\n- Columns arranged side by side for each block.\n\nTherefore, the output grid would have four rows and columns corresponding to the widths of the extracted blocks.\n\nThe threes block is 3 columns wide (columns 4-6), but since we\'re taking four rows, we need to decide on the column extent.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to define the block\'s column extent based on the non-zero columns.\n\nFor the threes block: columns 4-7.\n\nFor the twos block: columns 7-10.\n\nFor the fours block: columns 13-16.\n\nFor the ones block: columns 13-16.\n\nNow, extract the last four rows for each block:\n\n- Threes block: rows 3-5 (only three rows), so pad with one zero row at the top.\n\n- Twos block: rows 7-10 (four rows).\n\n- Fours block: rows 14-17 (last four rows).\n\n- Ones block: rows 18-21 (four rows).\n\nThen, arrange these extracted blocks side by side in the output grid.\n\nSo, the output grid would have:\n\n- Four rows.\n\n- Columns: first four columns for threes block (columns 4-7 of input).\n\n- Next four columns for twos block (columns 7-10 of input).\n\n- Next four columns for fours block (columns 13-16 of input).\n\n- Next four columns for ones block (columns 13-16 of input).\n\nWait, but the fours and ones blocks are in the same columns, so their columns overlap.\n\nHmm, perhaps in such cases, I need to arrange them sequentially, even if they overlap in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to arrange the blocks based on their column ranges without considering overlaps.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should treat each block as a separate entity and arrange them side by side in the order they appear from left to right and top to bottom.\n\nSo, in the output grid:\n\n- Columns 1-4: threes block (padded with one zero row at the top).\n\n- Columns 5-8: twos block.\n\n- Columns 9-12: fours block.\n\n- Columns 13-16: ones block.\n\nBut in the input, the fours and ones blocks are in the same columns, so in the output, they will be in separate columns.\n\nThis might not be accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps overlapping blocks in columns should be merged in the output.\n\nBut that seems unclear.\n\nI need to make a decision and proceed.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I\'ll proceed with arranging the blocks side by side in the order they appear, padding or truncating to four rows as necessary.\n\nSo, for the threes block: rows 2-5 (rows 3-5 with non-zero values, row 2 is zero), columns 4-7.\n\nFor the twos block: rows 7-10, columns 7-10.\n\nFor the fours block: rows 14-17, columns 13-16.\n\nFor the ones block: rows 18-21, columns 13-16.\n\nThen, in the output grid:\n\n- Rows 1-4: threes block (with one zero row at the top), columns 1-4.\n\n- Rows 1-4: twos block, columns 5-8.\n\n- Rows 1-4: fours block, columns 9-12.\n\n- Rows 1-4: ones block, columns 13-16.\n\nSo, the output grid would be 4 rows by 16 columns.\n\nBut in the training examples, the output grids have different dimensions, so perhaps the number of columns is adjustable based on the number of blocks.\n\nWait, in the first training example, there were two blocks side by side, resulting in 8 columns.\n\nIn the second training example, there were four blocks side by side, resulting in 12 columns.\n\nIn the third training example, there were six blocks side by side, resulting in 18 columns.\n\nSo, perhaps each block contributes a number of columns equal to the width of the block.\n\nIn this case, the threes block is 4 columns wide (columns 4-7), the twos block is 4 columns wide (columns 7-10), the fours block is 4 columns wide (columns 13-16), and the ones block is 4 columns wide (columns 13-16).\n\nWait, but columns 7-10 for twos and columns 13-16 for fours and ones.\n\nSo, in the output, it would be:\n\n- Columns 1-4: threes block (columns 4-7 of input).\n\n- Columns 5-8: twos block (columns 7-10 of input).\n\n- Columns 9-12: fours block (columns 13-16 of input).\n\n- Columns 13-16: ones block (columns 13-16 of input).\n\nSo, overall, 16 columns.\n\nNow, construct the output grid row by row.\n\nRow 1:\n\n- Columns 1-4: threes block, row 2 (since row 1 is zero): [0,0,0,0]\n\n- Columns 5-8: twos block, row 7: [0,0,2,2]\n\n- Columns 9-12: fours block, row 14: [0,0,4,4]\n\n- Columns 13-16: ones block, row 18: [0,0,1,1]\n\nSo, row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,4,4,0,0,1,1]\n\nRow 2:\n\n- Columns 1-4: threes block, row 3: [3,3,3,3]\n\n- Columns 5-8: twos block, row 8: [0,0,2,2]\n\n- Columns 9-12: fours block, row 15: [4,4,4,4]\n\n- Columns 13-16: ones block, row 19: [0,0,1,1]\n\nSo, row 2: [3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,0,0,1,1]\n\nRow 3:\n\n- Columns 1-4: threes block, row 4: [3,0,0,3]\n\n- Columns 5-8: twos block, row 9: [0,0,2,2]\n\n- Columns 9-12: fours block, row 16: [4,4,4,4]\n\n- Columns 13-16: ones block, row 20: [0,0,1,1]\n\nSo, row 3: [3,0,0,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,0,0,1,1]\n\nRow 4:\n\n- Columns 1-4: threes block, row 5: [3,3,3,3]\n\n- Columns 5-8: twos block, row 10: [0,0,2,2]\n\n- Columns 9-12: fours block, row 17: [4,4,4,4]\n\n- Columns 13-16: ones block, row 21: [1,1,1,1]\n\nSo, row 4: [3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1]\n\nTherefore, the output grid should be:\n\n[[0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,4,4,0,0,1,1],\n\n [3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,0,0,1,1],\n\n [3,0,0,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,0,0,1,1],\n\n [3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1]]\n\nBut wait, in the ones block, row 18 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],\n\nso columns 13-16 have [1,1,1,1].\n\nSimilarly, row 19 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0],\n\nso columns 13-16 have [1,1,0,0].\n\nRow 20 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0],\n\nso columns 13-16 have [1,1,0,0].\n\nRow 21 has [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0],\n\nso columns 13-16 have [1,1,1,1].\n\nTherefore, the ones block is:\n\nRow 18: [1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 19: [1,1,0,0]\n\nRow 20: [1,1,0,0]\n\nRow 21: [1,1,1,1]\n\nSo, in the output grid, the ones block contributes these rows to columns 13-16.\n\nSimilarly, the fours block is:\n\nRow 14: [4,4,4,4]\n\nRow 15: [4,4,4,4]\n\nRow 16: [4,4,4,4]\n\nRow 17: [4,4,4,4]\n\nSo, in the output grid, columns 9-12 have these values.\n\nTherefore, the output grid should be:\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0,0,4,4,1,1,1,1]\n\nRow 2: [3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [3,0,0,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,1,1,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [3,3,3,3,0,0,2,2,4,4,4,4,1,1,1,1]\n\nWait, but in row 1, the ones block is row 18, which has [1,1,1,1].\n\nSimilarly for other rows.\n\nSo, the output grid is 4 rows by 16 columns.\n\nBut in the training examples, the output grids have different numbers of columns, depending on the number of blocks.\n\nIn the first training example, there were two blocks side by side, resulting in 8 columns.\n\nIn the second training example, there were four blocks side by side, resulting in 12 columns.\n\nIn the third training example, there were six blocks side by side, resulting in 18 columns.\n\nSo, it seems that the number of columns in the output grid is determined by the number of blocks extracted from the input grid.\n\nIn this test input, there are four blocks: threes, twos,', 'final_json': None, 'retries': 0, 'task_id': '20241222_203330'}
