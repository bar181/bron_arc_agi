Raw model response:
I'm going to tackle this puzzle step by step. Let's see what's going on here. There are training examples with inputs and outputs, and I need to find a pattern or transformation that maps the input to the output, then apply that to the test input.

First, let's look at the training examples.

**Example 0:**

Input:

- A 11x11 grid with numbers like 0, 4, 5.

Output:

- A list of lists: [[2], [2], [2], [2]]

**Example 1:**

Input:

- A 12x12 grid with numbers like 0, 2, 6, 8.

Output:

- A list of lists: [[7, 7], [7, 7]]

**Example 2:**

Input:

- A 13x13 grid with numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3, 6.

Output:

- A list of lists: [[2, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1]]

And the test input is a 13x13 grid with numbers like 0, 4, 5, 8.

So, I need to figure out what transformation is being applied to get from the input grid to the output list of lists.

Looking at the outputs, they seem to be lists of numbers, and the number of sublists varies between examples.

In Example 0, there are four sublists, each containing a single number 2.

In Example 1, there are two sublists, each containing two number 7's.

In Example 2, there are two sublists, one with [2,1,2] and another with [1,1,1].

Looking back at the inputs, they are all grids with some numbers arranged in certain patterns.

I need to find a way to extract these numbers from the grid based on some rule.

One possibility is that the output is derived from specific positions in the grid, maybe along certain paths or based on connectivity.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to connected components in the grid, where numbers are grouped if they are adjacent.

Wait, in Example 0, the output is [2] four times. Looking at the input grid, number 2 appears only in row 3, column 9 and row 4, column 10. But why four [2] in the output?

Similarly, in Example 1, number 7 appears in rows 9 and 10, columns 5 and 6, and the output is [7,7] twice.

In Example 2, numbers 2,1,2 and 1,1,1 appear in different parts of the grid.

Hmm.

Perhaps the output corresponds to certain paths or lines in the grid.

Wait, looking back, in all training examples, the grids have symmetries or patterns that could be exploited.

Wait, another thought: in Example 0, the number 2 appears only in row 4, column 10, and row 5, column 10. Maybe it's extracting values from specific columns or rows.

But in Example 1, number 7 appears in rows 9 and 10, columns 5 and 6, and the output has [7,7] twice.

Similarly, in Example 2, numbers 2,1,2 appear in certain rows and columns.

Maybe the output corresponds to reading specific columns or rows from the grid.

Wait, in Example 0, if I look at columns 10 and 11, they contain 0's mostly, but in row 3, column 10 has a 2.

Wait, but that doesn't align with the output having [2] four times.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the unique non-zero values in certain parts of the grid.

But that doesn't explain the repetition in the output.

Wait, perhaps it's about reading specific lines or paths through the grid.

Wait, looking at the test input, it's a 13x13 grid.

Wait, actually, in Example 0, the grid is 11x11, Example 1 is 12x12, Example 2 is 13x13, and the test input is also 13x13.

So, perhaps there's a pattern based on the size of the grid.

Alternatively, maybe it's about extracting values along the diagonals or specific strips of the grid.

Wait, in Example 0, the output is [2] four times. Maybe it's extracting the values from the center of the grid.

But in a 11x11 grid, the center would be around row 6, column 6, but in the input, the number 2 appears in row 4, column 10.

That doesn't seem to align.

Wait, maybe it's about the last few columns.

In Example 0, the last column has all 0's, except row 3 has a 4, row 4 has a 2, etc.

Wait, in Example 0, column 11 has all 0's except row 3 has a 4, row 4 has a 2, row 5 has a 2, row 6 has a 2, row 7 has a 2.

Wait, but the output has [2] four times.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's about the non-zero values in the last few columns.

But that doesn't directly explain the output.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the unique non-zero values in certain sections of the grid.

Wait, maybe it's about the unique non-zero values in each row, but that doesn't explain the output format.

Wait, in Example 1, the output is [[7,7], [7,7]].

Looking at the input grid, numbers 7,7 appear in rows 9 and 10, columns 5 and 6.

So, perhaps it's extracting values from specific blocks or subgrids.

Similarly, in Example 2, the output is [[2,1,2], [1,1,1]], which corresponds to values in certain parts of the grid.

Wait, perhaps it's about extracting values from the intersections of certain rows and columns.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the unique non-zero values in specific columns.

Wait, another idea: perhaps it's about the values in the grid that are surrounded by zeros or stand alone.

But that doesn't align with the output in Example 0, where [2] appears four times.

Wait, perhaps it's about the values in specific positions relative to the center of the grid.

Given that the grids are square and have odd sizes, there is a central cell.

But in Example 0, the central cell is row 6, column 6, which is 0.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's about the values in the grid that are not adjacent to any other non-zero values.

But in Example 0, the number 2 is adjacent to other non-zero values.

Wait, maybe it's about paths or sequences of non-zero values.

Wait, in Example 0, the number 2 appears in row 4, column 10, and row 5, column 10.

Similarly, in Example 1, number 7 appears in rows 9 and 10, columns 5 and 6.

Wait, perhaps it's about extracting the values from specific columns across all rows.

But that doesn't explain why Example 0 has [2] four times.

Wait, looking back at Example 0's output: [[2], [2], [2], [2]]

Maybe it's extracting the values from every nth column or row.

Wait, in Example 0, the grid is 11x11, and the output has four [2]'s.

Similarly, in Example 1, the grid is 12x12, and the output has two [7,7]'s.

In Example 2, the grid is 13x13, and the output has two sublists.

So, perhaps there's a pattern based on the size of the grid regarding how many sublists are in the output.

Wait, in Example 0, 11 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder, and 12 divided by 3 is 4, but the output has four [2]'s.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the values in the grid that are on specific diagonals.

But in Example 0, the number 2 is not on the main diagonals.

Wait, perhaps it's about the values in the grid that are isolated or form specific patterns.

Wait, maybe it's about the values in the grid that are the max in their row or column.

But in Example 0, the number 5 is larger than 2 and 4 in some rows.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's about the values in the grid that are part of certain features, like corners or intersections.

But that seems too vague.

Wait, let's consider that in Example 0, the number 2 appears in rows 3,4,5,6 in column 10.

And the output has [2] four times.

So, maybe it's extracting the values from column 10 in rows 3,4,5,6.

Similarly, in Example 1, number 7 appears in rows 9 and 10, columns 5 and 6, and the output has [7,7] twice.

Perhaps it's extracting values from specific blocks or sections of the grid.

Wait, perhaps it's about extracting values from the rightmost non-zero column.

In Example 0, the rightmost non-zero column is column 10, which has 2's in rows 3,4,5,6.

Hence, the output has [2] four times.

In Example 1, the rightmost non-zero column is column 5 and 6, which have 7's in rows 9 and 10.

So, the output has [7,7] twice.

In Example 2, the rightmost non-zero columns are columns 10,11,12, which have 2,1,2 and 1,1,1 in certain rows.

Hence, the output is [[2,1,2], [1,1,1]].

This seems plausible.

So, the pattern is:

- Identify the rightmost non-zero columns.

- Extract the values from these columns in the rows where they are non-zero.

- Arrange these values into sublists based on some criterion.

In Example 0, the rightmost non-zero column is column 10, which has 2's in rows 3,4,5,6.

Hence, the output is [[2], [2], [2], [2]].

In Example 1, the rightmost non-zero columns are columns 5 and 6, which have 7's in rows 9 and 10.

Hence, the output is [[7,7], [7,7]].

In Example 2, the rightmost non-zero columns are columns 10,11,12, which have values arranged in certain rows.

Hence, the output is [[2,1,2], [1,1,1]].

So, for the test input, which is a 13x13 grid, I need to:

- Identify the rightmost non-zero columns.

- Extract the values from these columns in the rows where they are non-zero.

- Arrange these values into sublists based on the number of non-zero rows.

Looking at the test input:

- The rightmost non-zero columns are columns 10,11,12.

- In column 10:

- Row 1: 0

- Row 2: 0

- Row 3: 0

- Row 4: 0

- Row 5: 0

- Row 6: 0

- Row 7: 0

- Row 8: 0

- Row 9: 0

- Row 10: 0

- Row 11: 5

- Row 12: 0

- Row 13: 0

So, only row 11 has a 5.

- In column 11:

- Row 1: 0

- Row 2: 0

- Row 3: 0

- Row 4: 0

- Row 5: 0

- Row 6: 0

- Row 7: 0

- Row 8: 0

- Row 9: 0

- Row 10: 0

- Row 11: 5

- Row 12: 0

- Row 13: 0

So, only row 11 has a 5.

- In column 12:

- Row 1: 0

- Row 2: 0

- Row 3: 0

- Row 4: 0

- Row 5: 0

- Row 6: 0

- Row 7: 0

- Row 8: 0

- Row 9: 0

- Row 10: 0

- Row 11: 5

- Row 12: 0

- Row 13: 0

So, only row 11 has a 5.

Therefore, in the rightmost non-zero columns (10,11,12), only row 11 has non-zero values (5,5,5).

Hence, the output should be a list of lists, each corresponding to the values in these columns for the rows where they are non-zero.

Since only row 11 has non-zero values in these columns, and the values are [5,5,5], the output should be [[5,5,5]].

But in Example 2, the output has two sublists, [[2,1,2], [1,1,1]], which correspond to rows where there are non-zero values in the rightmost columns.

Wait, in Example 2, rows 7 and 10 have non-zero values in the rightmost columns, hence two sublists.

Similarly, in the test input, only row 11 has non-zero values in the rightmost columns, so only one sublist.

But in Example 0, there are four rows with non-zero values in the rightmost columns, hence four sublists.

Similarly in Example 1, there are two rows with non-zero values in the rightmost columns, hence two sublists.

So, based on this, for the test input, only row 11 has non-zero values in the rightmost columns, so the output should be [[5,5,5]].

But perhaps I need to consider more than just the rightmost columns.

Wait, in Example 2, the output has two sublists, corresponding to rows 7 and 10, each with values from the rightmost columns.

Similarly, in the test input, only row 11 has non-zero values in the rightmost columns, so [[5,5,5]].

But let's double-check.

In Example 0, the rightmost non-zero column is column 10, with 2's in rows 3,4,5,6.

Hence, four sublists, each [2].

In Example 1, the rightmost non-zero columns are columns 5 and 6, with 7's in rows 9 and 10.

Hence, two sublists, each [7,7].

In Example 2, the rightmost non-zero columns are columns 10,11,12, with values in rows 7 and 10.

Hence, two sublists, [[2,1,2], [1,1,1]].

So, for the test input, only row 11 has non-zero values in the rightmost columns, so one sublist with the values from columns 10,11,12, which are 5,5,5.

Hence, [[5,5,5]].

But to confirm, perhaps I should look at the number of non-zero rows in the rightmost columns.

In Example 0: 4 non-zero rows in the rightmost column → 4 sublists.

In Example 1: 2 non-zero rows in the rightmost columns → 2 sublists.

In Example 2: 2 non-zero rows in the rightmost columns → 2 sublists.

Test input: 1 non-zero row in the rightmost columns → 1 sublist.

Therefore, the output should be [[5,5,5]].

But let's make sure that's correct.

Wait, in Example 0, why is the output [2] four times, not [4,2,2,2] or something else?

Looking back, in Example 0, column 10 has:

- Row 3: 2

- Row 4: 2

- Row 5: 2

- Row 6: 2

Hence, four [2]'s.

Similarly, in Example 1, columns 5 and 6 have:

- Row 9: 7 and 7

- Row 10: 7 and 7

Hence, two [7,7].

In Example 2, columns 10,11,12 have:

- Row 7: 2,1,2

- Row 10: 1,1,1

Hence, two sublists.

So, for the test input, columns 10,11,12 have:

- Row 11: 5,5,5

Hence, one sublist [5,5,5].

So, the output should be [[5,5,5]].

But to be thorough, perhaps I should consider if there are multiple rows with non-zero values in the rightmost columns.

In the test input, only row 11 has non-zero values in columns 10,11,12.

If there were more rows with non-zero values in these columns, I would have more sublists.

But as it stands, only one row meets this criterion.

Therefore, the output is [[5,5,5]].

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or transformation that maps the given input grid to the specified output format, based on the provided training examples, and then apply this pattern to the test input.

### Approach

1. **Identify Rightmost Non-Zero Columns**:
   - Determine the columns in the grid that contain the highest column indices with non-zero values.
   
2. **Extract Values from These Columns**:
   - For each row in the grid, if any of the rightmost columns have non-zero values, collect the values from these columns in a sublist.

3. **Form Output Structure**:
   - Compile these sublists into the final output array, ensuring that only rows with non-zero values in the rightmost columns are included.

### Solution Code

```python
def solve_puzzle(input_grid):
    num_rows = len(input_grid)
    num_cols = len(input_grid[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    
    # Find the rightmost non-zero columns
    rightmost_cols = []
    for c in range(num_cols-1, -1, -1):
        for r in range(num_rows):
            if input_grid[r][c] != 0:
                rightmost_cols.append(c)
                break
        if rightmost_cols:
            break
    # In case all columns are zero, though unlikely based on examples
    if not rightmost_cols:
        return []
    
    # Determine the range of rows that have non-zero values in the rightmost columns
    rows_with_non_zero = []
    for r in range(num_rows):
        if any(input_grid[r][c] != 0 for c in rightmost_cols):
            rows_with_non_zero.append(r)
    
    # Extract values from the rightmost non-zero columns for these rows
    output = []
    for r in rows_with_non_zero:
        row_values = [input_grid[r][c] for c in rightmost_cols]
        output.append(row_values)
    
    return output

    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

```

### Explanation

- **Identify Rightmost Non-Zero Columns**:
  - We iterate from the last column to the first, and for each column, check if any cell in that column contains a non-zero value. We collect these columns in `rightmost_cols`.

- **Extract Values from These Columns**:
  - We then identify rows that have non-zero values in these rightmost columns.
  - For each such row, we collect the values from the rightmost columns and form a sublist.

- **Form Output Structure**:
  - These sublists are compiled into the final output array, which is then returned as the solution.

This approach ensures that we correctly map the input grid to the desired output format based on the observed pattern in the training examples.

Let's see what's going on here. There are training examples with inputs and outputs, and I need to find a pattern or transformation that maps the input to the output, then apply that to the test input.\n\nFirst, let's look at the training examples.\n\n**Example 0:**\n\nInput:\n\n- A 11x11 grid with numbers like 0, 4, 5.\n\nOutput:\n\n- A list of lists: [[2], [2], [2], [2]]\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nInput:\n\n- A 12x12 grid with numbers like 0, 2, 6, 8.\n\nOutput:\n\n- A list of lists: [[7, 7], [7, 7]]\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nInput:\n\n- A 13x13 grid with numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nOutput:\n\n- A list of lists: [[2, 1, 2], [1, 1, 1]]\n\nAnd the test input is a 13x13 grid with numbers like 0, 4, 5, 8.\n\nSo, I need to figure out what transformation is being applied to get from the input grid to the output list of lists.\n\nLooking at the outputs, they seem to be lists of numbers, and the number of sublists varies between examples.\n\nIn Example 0, there are four sublists, each containing a single number 2.\n\nIn Example 1, there are two sublists, each containing two number 7's.\n\nIn Example 2, there are two sublists, one with [2,1,2] and another with [1,1,1].\n\nLooking back at the inputs, they are all grids with some numbers arranged in certain patterns.\n\nI need to find a way to extract these numbers from the grid based on some rule.\n\nOne possibility is that the output is derived from specific positions in the grid, maybe along certain paths or based on connectivity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's related to connected components in the grid, where numbers are grouped if they are adjacent.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the output is [2] four times. Looking at the input grid, number 2 appears only in row 3, column 9 and row 4, column 10. But why four [2] in the output?\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, number 7 appears in rows 9 and 10, columns 5 and 6, and the output is [7,7] twice.\n\nIn Example 2, numbers 2,1,2 and 1,1,1 appear in different parts of the grid.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the output corresponds to certain paths or lines in the grid.\n\nWait, looking back, in all training examples, the grids have symmetries or patterns that could be exploited.\n\nWait, another thought: in Example 0, the number 2 appears only in row 4, column 10, and row 5, column 10. Maybe it's extracting values from specific columns or rows.\n\nBut in Example 1, number 7 appears in rows 9 and 10, columns 5 and 6, and the output has [7,7] twice.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, numbers 2,1,2 appear in certain rows and columns.\n\nMaybe the output corresponds to reading specific columns or rows from the grid.\n\nWait, in Example 0, if I look at columns 10 and 11, they contain 0's mostly, but in row 3, column 10 has a 2.\n\nWait, but that doesn't align with the output having [2] four times.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the unique non-zero values in certain parts of the grid.\n\nBut that doesn't explain the repetition in the output.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about reading specific lines or paths through the grid.\n\nWait, looking at the test input, it's a 13x13 grid.\n\nWait, actually, in Example 0, the grid is 11x11, Example 1 is 12x12, Example 2 is 13x13, and the test input is also 13x13.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a pattern based on the size of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about extracting values along the diagonals or specific strips of the grid.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the output is [2] four times. Maybe it's extracting the values from the center of the grid.\n\nBut in a 11x11 grid, the center would be around row 6, column 6, but in the input, the number 2 appears in row 4, column 10.\n\nThat doesn't seem to align.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the last few columns.\n\nIn Example 0, the last column has all 0's, except row 3 has a 4, row 4 has a 2, etc.\n\nWait, in Example 0, column 11 has all 0's except row 3 has a 4, row 4 has a 2, row 5 has a 2, row 6 has a 2, row 7 has a 2.\n\nWait, but the output has [2] four times.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the non-zero values in the last few columns.\n\nBut that doesn't directly explain the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the unique non-zero values in certain sections of the grid.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the unique non-zero values in each row, but that doesn't explain the output format.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output is [[7,7], [7,7]].\n\nLooking at the input grid, numbers 7,7 appear in rows 9 and 10, columns 5 and 6.\n\nSo, perhaps it's extracting values from specific blocks or subgrids.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the output is [[2,1,2], [1,1,1]], which corresponds to values in certain parts of the grid.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about extracting values from the intersections of certain rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about the unique non-zero values in specific columns.\n\nWait, another idea: perhaps it's about the values in the grid that are surrounded by zeros or stand alone.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the output in Example 0, where [2] appears four times.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the values in specific positions relative to the center of the grid.\n\nGiven that the grids are square and have odd sizes, there is a central cell.\n\nBut in Example 0, the central cell is row 6, column 6, which is 0.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the values in the grid that are not adjacent to any other non-zero values.\n\nBut in Example 0, the number 2 is adjacent to other non-zero values.\n\nWait, maybe it's about paths or sequences of non-zero values.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the number 2 appears in row 4, column 10, and row 5, column 10.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, number 7 appears in rows 9 and 10, columns 5 and 6.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about extracting the values from specific columns across all rows.\n\nBut that doesn't explain why Example 0 has [2] four times.\n\nWait, looking back at Example 0's output: [[2], [2], [2], [2]]\n\nMaybe it's extracting the values from every nth column or row.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the grid is 11x11, and the output has four [2]'s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the grid is 12x12, and the output has two [7,7]'s.\n\nIn Example 2, the grid is 13x13, and the output has two sublists.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a pattern based on the size of the grid regarding how many sublists are in the output.\n\nWait, in Example 0, 11 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder, and 12 divided by 3 is 4, but the output has four [2]'s.\n\nWait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the values in the grid that are on specific diagonals.\n\nBut in Example 0, the number 2 is not on the main diagonals.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the values in the grid that are isolated or form specific patterns.\n\nWait, maybe it's about the values in the grid that are the max in their row or column.\n\nBut in Example 0, the number 5 is larger than 2 and 4 in some rows.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about the values in the grid that are part of certain features, like corners or intersections.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nWait, let's consider that in Example 0, the number 2 appears in rows 3,4,5,6 in column 10.\n\nAnd the output has [2] four times.\n\nSo, maybe it's extracting the values from column 10 in rows 3,4,5,6.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, number 7 appears in rows 9 and 10, columns 5 and 6, and the output has [7,7] twice.\n\nPerhaps it's extracting values from specific blocks or sections of the grid.\n\nWait, perhaps it's about extracting values from the rightmost non-zero column.\n\nIn Example 0, the rightmost non-zero column is column 10, which has 2's in rows 3,4,5,6.\n\nHence, the output has [2] four times.\n\nIn Example 1, the rightmost non-zero column is column 5 and 6, which have 7's in rows 9 and 10.\n\nSo, the output has [7,7] twice.\n\nIn Example 2, the rightmost non-zero columns are columns 10,11,12, which have 2,1,2 and 1,1,1 in certain rows.\n\nHence, the output is [[2,1,2], [1,1,1]].\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nSo, the pattern is:\n\n- Identify the rightmost non-zero columns.\n\n- Extract the values from these columns in the rows where they are non-zero.\n\n- Arrange these values into sublists based on some criterion.\n\nIn Example 0, the rightmost non-zero column is column 10, which has 2's in rows 3,4,5,6.\n\nHence, the output is [[2], [2], [2], [2]].\n\nIn Example 1, the rightmost non-zero columns are columns 5 and 6, which have 7's in rows 9 and 10.\n\nHence, the output is [[7,7], [7,7]].\n\nIn Example 2, the rightmost non-zero columns are columns 10,11,12, which have values arranged in certain rows.\n\nHence, the output is [[2,1,2], [1,1,1]].\n\nSo, for the test input, which is a 13x13 grid, I need to:\n\n- Identify the rightmost non-zero columns.\n\n- Extract the values from these columns in the rows where they are non-zero.\n\n- Arrange these values into sublists based on the number of non-zero rows.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n- The rightmost non-zero columns are columns 10,11,12.\n\n- In column 10:\n\n- Row 1: 0\n\n- Row 2: 0\n\n- Row 3: 0\n\n- Row 4: 0\n\n- Row 5: 0\n\n- Row 6: 0\n\n- Row 7: 0\n\n- Row 8: 0\n\n- Row 9: 0\n\n- Row 10: 0\n\n- Row 11: 5\n\n- Row 12: 0\n\n- Row 13: 0\n\nSo, only row 11 has a 5.\n\n- In column 11:\n\n- Row 1: 0\n\n- Row 2: 0\n\n- Row 3: 0\n\n- Row 4: 0\n\n- Row 5: 0\n\n- Row 6: 0\n\n- Row 7: 0\n\n- Row 8: 0\n\n- Row 9: 0\n\n- Row 10: 0\n\n- Row 11: 5\n\n- Row 12: 0\n\n- Row 13: 0\n\nSo, only row 11 has a 5.\n\n- In column 12:\n\n- Row 1: 0\n\n- Row 2: 0\n\n- Row 3: 0\n\n- Row 4: 0\n\n- Row 5: 0\n\n- Row 6: 0\n\n- Row 7: 0\n\n- Row 8: 0\n\n- Row 9: 0\n\n- Row 10: 0\n\n- Row 11: 5\n\n- Row 12: 0\n\n- Row 13: 0\n\nSo, only row 11 has a 5.\n\nTherefore, in the rightmost non-zero columns (10,11,12), only row 11 has non-zero values (5,5,5).\n\nHence, the output should be a list of lists, each corresponding to the values in these columns for the rows where they are non-zero.\n\nSince only row 11 has non-zero values in these columns, and the values are [5,5,5], the output should be [[5,5,5]].\n\nBut in Example 2, the output has two sublists, [[2,1,2], [1,1,1]], which correspond to rows where there are non-zero values in the rightmost columns.\n\nWait, in Example 2, rows 7 and 10 have non-zero values in the rightmost columns, hence two sublists.\n\nSimilarly, in the test input, only row 11 has non-zero values in the rightmost columns, so only one sublist.\n\nBut in Example 0, there are four rows with non-zero values in the rightmost columns, hence four sublists.\n\nSimilarly in Example 1, there are two rows with non-zero values in the rightmost columns, hence two sublists.\n\nSo, based on this, for the test input, only row 11 has non-zero values in the rightmost columns, so the output should be [[5,5,5]].\n\nBut perhaps I need to consider more than just the rightmost columns.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has two sublists, corresponding to rows 7 and 10, each with values from the rightmost columns.\n\nSimilarly, in the test input, only row 11 has non-zero values in the rightmost columns, so [[5,5,5]].\n\nBut let's double-check.\n\nIn Example 0, the rightmost non-zero column is column 10, with 2's in rows 3,4,5,6.\n\nHence, four sublists, each [2].\n\nIn Example 1, the rightmost non-zero columns are columns 5 and 6, with 7's in rows 9 and 10.\n\nHence, two sublists, each [7,7].\n\nIn Example 2, the rightmost non-zero columns are columns 10,11,12, with values in rows 7 and 10.\n\nHence, two sublists, [[2,1,2], [1,1,1]].\n\nSo, for the test input, only row 11 has non-zero values in the rightmost columns, so one sublist with the values from columns 10,11,12, which are 5,5,5.\n\nHence, [[5,5,5]].\n\nBut to confirm, perhaps I should look at the number of non-zero rows in the rightmost columns.\n\nIn Example 0: 4 non-zero rows in the rightmost column → 4 sublists.\n\nIn Example 1: 2 non-zero rows in the rightmost columns → 2 sublists.\n\nIn Example 2: 2 non-zero rows in the rightmost columns → 2 sublists.\n\nTest input: 1 non-zero row in the rightmost columns → 1 sublist.\n\nTherefore, the output should be [[5,5,5]].\n\nBut let's make sure that's correct.\n\nWait, in Example 0, why is the output [2] four times, not [4,2,2,2] or something else?\n\nLooking back, in Example 0, column 10 has:\n\n- Row 3: 2\n\n- Row 4: 2\n\n- Row 5: 2\n\n- Row 6: 2\n\nHence, four [2]'s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, columns 5 and 6 have:\n\n- Row 9: 7 and 7\n\n- Row 10: 7 and 7\n\nHence, two [7,7].\n\nIn Example 2, columns 10,11,12 have:\n\n- Row 7: 2,1,2\n\n- Row 10: 1,1,1\n\nHence, two sublists.\n\nSo, for the test input, columns 10,11,12 have:\n\n- Row 11: 5,5,5\n\nHence, one sublist [5,5,5].\n\nSo, the output should be [[5,5,5]].\n\nBut to be thorough, perhaps I should consider if there are multiple rows with non-zero values in the rightmost columns.\n\nIn the test input, only row 11 has non-zero values in columns 10,11,12.\n\nIf there were more rows with non-zero values in these columns, I would have more sublists.\n\nBut as it stands, only one row meets this criterion.\n\nTherefore, the output is [[5,5,5]].\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or transformation that maps the given input grid to the specified output format, based on the provided training examples, and then apply this pattern to the test input.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Rightmost Non-Zero Columns**:\n   - Determine the columns in the grid that contain the highest column indices with non-zero values.\n   \n2. **Extract Values from These Columns**:\n   - For each row in the grid, if any of the rightmost columns have non-zero values, collect the values from these columns in a sublist.\n\n3. **Form Output Structure**:\n   - Compile these sublists into the final output array, ensuring that only rows with non-zero values in the rightmost columns are included.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef

Explanation\n\n- **Identify Rightmost Non-Zero Columns**:\n  - We iterate from the last column to the first, and for each column, check if any cell in that column contains a non-zero value. We collect these columns in `rightmost_cols`.\n\n- **Extract Values from These Columns**:\n  - We then identify rows that have non-zero values in these rightmost columns.\n  - For each such row, we collect the values from the rightmost columns and form a sublist.\n\n- **Form Output Structure**:\n  - These sublists are compiled into the final output array, which is then returned as the solution.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly map the input grid to the desired output format based on the observed pattern in the training examples.", 'final_json': None, 'retries': 0, 'task_id': '20241222_202452'}
