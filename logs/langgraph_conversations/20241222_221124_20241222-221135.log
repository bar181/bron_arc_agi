Raw model response:
 

[6, 6, 0, 0, 6]

[0, 0, 6, 0, 0]

[0, 6, 0, 6, 0]

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or transformation that maps the given input arrays to the corresponding output arrays in the training examples. Once we understand this pattern, we can apply it to the test input to generate the final output.

### Approach

1. **Observation and Pattern Recognition**:
   - Analyze the training examples to identify how the input arrays are transformed into the output arrays.
   - Look for consistent operations or rules that apply across multiple training examples.

2. **Generalize the Pattern**:
   - Formulate a general rule or set of steps that can be applied to any input array to produce the correct output array.

3. **Apply the Pattern to the Test Input**:
   - Use the identified pattern to transform the test input array into the desired output format.

### Solution Code

```json
[[6, 6, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 6, 0, 6, 0]]
```

### Explanation

1. **Pattern Identification**:
   - Upon examining the training examples, it's observed that the transformation involves converting certain values in the input arrays to new values in the output arrays based on specific rules.
   - Specifically, the value `9` in the input seems to be transformed to `6` in the output, and the value `4` is transformed to `0`, while `0` remains `0`.

2. **Generalization**:
   - The transformation can be generalized as:
     - Replace `9` with `6`.
     - Replace `4` with `0`.
     - Keep `0` as is.
   - This rule is consistently applied across all training examples.

3. **Application to Test Input**:
   - Apply the identified transformation to each element in the test input arrays.
   - For example, the first array `[9, 9, 0, 9, 0]` becomes `[6, 6, 0, 6, 0]`.
   - However, comparing this with the training examples, it seems there's an additional aspect involving the positions or combinations of values.
   - Further analysis reveals that the transformation also involves checking neighboring elements, possibly in a grid-like fashion, considering rows and columns.

4. **Refinement**:
   - Considering the input arrays as rows of a grid, the transformation might involve operations like:
     - For each position, if the corresponding positions in certain input rows meet specific criteria, transform accordingly.
   - A more precise rule might be:
     - For each column, if there is a `9` in any of the first few rows and a `4` in one of the later rows, set the output to `6`; otherwise, set to `0`.

5. **Final Transformation**:
   - After refining the rule based on all training examples, apply it to the test input to get the final output as `[[6,6,0,0,6],[0,0,6,0,0],[0,6,0,6,0]]`.
