Raw model response:
I'm going to tackle this puzzle. It seems like I have several training examples that show input grids transforming into output grids. My goal is to figure out the pattern or rule that's being applied in these transformations so I can apply it to the test input.

First, I need to carefully observe the changes from input to output in each example.

Looking at Example 0:

Input:

- A 10x10 grid mostly filled with 0s, except for a single 1 in row 4, column 3, and a 2 in row 7, column 5.

Output:

- The 1 is now surrounded by 5s in rows 3 and 4, columns 3 to 5.

- Similarly, the 2 is also surrounded by 5s.

- There's a 5 between the 1 and the 2, and some other changes.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of spreading or filling in certain patterns.

Let me look at Example 1:

Input:

- A 10x10 grid with a 3 in row 2, column 3, and a 1 in row 6, column 6.

Output:

- The 3 is surrounded by 5s, and the 1 is also surrounded by 5s, with some overlapping in between.

It seems like whenever there's a number greater than 0, it's being used as a seed to fill in surrounding cells with 5s, and possibly interacting with other seeds.

Example 2:

Input:

- A 10x10 grid with a 3 in row 2, column 4, a 2 in row 4, column 6, and a 1 in row 6, column 7.

Output:

- The 3 is surrounded by 5s, the 2 by 5s, and the 1 by 5s, with some interactions where their influence overlaps.

- In areas where multiple seeds' influences meet, there are numbers like 4 appearing.

This makes me think that different seeds have areas of influence, and where these areas overlap, specific rules apply to determine the output value.

Example 3:

Input:

- An 11x11 grid with a 2 in row 4, column 5, a 6 in row 6, column 3, and a 1 in row 9, column 7.

Output:

- The 2, 6, and 1 each have areas surrounded by 5s, and where their areas meet, there are 4s.

- There's a diagonal pattern with 4s and 5s connecting different seeds.

Example 4:

Input:

- An 11x11 grid with a 1 in row 2, column 3, a 2 in row 4, column 5, and a 3 in row 6, column 8.

Output:

- Similar pattern: seeds surrounded by 5s, with interactions leading to 4s in overlapping areas.

Example 5:

Input:

- A 9x9 grid with a 6 in row 7, column 4.

Output:

- The 6 is surrounded by 5s in a kind of blob.

From all these examples, it seems like the key elements are:

- Seeds (numbers greater than 0) that influence their surroundings.

- The influence spreads to adjacent cells, filling them with 5s.

- When influences from different seeds meet, specific rules determine the values at the boundaries or overlaps.

I need to define more precisely how these influences spread and interact.

First, let's consider how the influence spreads from a seed.

In Example 5, there's only one seed, a 6 in row 7, column 4. In the output, this seed is surrounded by 5s in a sort of blob shape. It looks like the 5s are spreading out from the seed.

Looking back at other examples, it seems that the 5s spread in a sort of region growing from each seed.

But in areas where two seeds' regions would overlap, there are 4s, and sometimes 3s or other numbers.

Wait, in Example 2, there's a 4 appearing where influences meet.

Wait, in Example 2, row 5, column 5 has a 4, which is between a 3 and a 2.

Similarly, in Example 4, row 5, column 6 has a 2, which is between a 2 and a 3.

This is confusing. Maybe the numbers represent different things.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps the seeds are like points in a Voronoi diagram, where each seed has a region of influence consisting of all cells closer to it than to any other seed.

In such a case, the regions would be separated by boundaries where the distance to two seeds is equal.

But in these examples, it seems like the regions are spreading with 5s, and the boundaries have 4s.

Wait, but in Example 2, there are 4s, 5s, and even a 3 in the output.

I need to find a consistent rule that applies across all examples.

Let me consider the following hypothesis:

- Each non-zero number in the input grid is a seed.

- From each seed, 5s spread to adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically, not diagonally).

- The original seed number is replaced by a 5.

- When two spreading regions from different seeds meet, the boundary cells between them are set to 4.

- If three or more regions meet at a point, it might be set to a different number, like 3 or less, but I need to check.

Let me test this hypothesis against Example 0.

In Example 0:

- Seeds are 1 and 2.

- In the output, both are replaced by 5s, and surrounded by 5s.

- Between them, there are 5s and a 4 where their regions meet.

This seems consistent.

In Example 1:

- Seeds are 3 and 1.

- Output shows 5s spreading from both, with 4s where they meet.

Again, consistent.

In Example 2:

- Seeds are 3, 2, and 1.

- Output shows 5s spreading from each, with 4s where two regions meet, and possibly 4s where three regions meet.

Wait, in row 5, column 5, there's a 4, which is between 3, 2, and possibly 1.

Hmm, maybe 4s are used where any two regions meet, and higher overlaps might have lower numbers, but it's not clearly decreasing.

In Example 3:

- Seeds are 2, 6, and 1.

- Output shows 5s spreading from each, with 4s where they meet.

- There's a diagonal of 4s connecting different seeds.

In Example 4:

- Seeds are 1, 2, and 3.

- Output shows 5s from each, with 4s where they meet.

- In row 5, column 5, there's a 2, which might indicate something different.

Wait, perhaps the number in the boundary cells is determined by the sum or some function of the seeds' values.

Wait, in Example 4, row 5, column 5 is a 2, but the seeds are 1, 2, and 3.

This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the boundary cells take the minimum or maximum of the adjacent seeds.

In Example 4, row 5, column 5 is a 2, which is the value of one of the seeds.

But in other examples, boundaries have 4s, which aren't present in the input seeds.

This suggests that 4 is a special value for boundaries.

Wait, perhaps 4 is used specifically for boundaries between two seeds.

In Example 2, row 5, column 5 is a 4, which is between seeds 3 and 2.

Similarly, in Example 3, boundaries have 4s.

So maybe:

- 5s spread from each seed.

- Where two regions meet, place a 4.

- The original seed cells are replaced by 5s.

But in Example 2, there are 4s not directly adjacent to seeds, like in row 6, column 5, which is a 3.

Wait, in Example 2, row 6, column 5 is a 3, which is surrounded by 4s and 5s.

This suggests that perhaps the original seed value is preserved in some cells.

Wait, no, in most examples, seeds are replaced by 5s.

In Example 2, the 3 in row 2, column 4 is replaced by 5s in the output.

Wait, but in row 5, column 5, which is not a seed, is a 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of flood fill or region growing.

Let me consider the following steps:

1. Identify all seeds (cells with values greater than 0).

2. For each seed, perform a flood fill with 5s to adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically), stopping at boundaries formed by other seeds.

3. Where flood fills from different seeds meet, place 4s in the boundary cells.

But in some examples, there are higher numbers like 5s and lower numbers like 4s, and occasionally 3s or 2s.

Wait, maybe the numbers are being combined in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps the output is based on the number of seeds influencing a cell.

- Cells influenced by one seed: 5.

- Cells influenced by two seeds: 4.

- Cells influenced by three seeds: 3.

- And so on.

But in Example 4, there's a cell with a 2, which would suggest influence by two seeds, but in other examples, two-seed influences have 4s.

This inconsistency suggests that my assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe 5 represents cells influenced by a seed, and 4 represents boundaries.

But in some examples, there are cells with 4 that are not directly adjacent to seeds.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the test input:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Seeds are 1 at row 2, column 1; 2 at row 6, column 7; 6 at row 7, column 5; and 3 at row 7, column 9.

I need to apply the pattern I deduce from the training examples to this test input.

Perhaps I should consider the following steps:

1. Identify all seeds.

2. For each seed, mark its cell and adjacent cells with 5s, but only if not blocked by other seeds.

3. Where the influence of two seeds meets, place a 4.

4. Continue this process until all cells are filled according to the rules.

But I need a more precise algorithm.

Looking back at the examples, it seems that the 5s spread from seeds, and 4s are placed in cells where the influence of two different seeds meets.

Moreover, in some cases, higher numbers like 5s are used in the regions, and lower numbers like 4s in the boundaries.

I need to see if there's a consistent way to determine the output based on the input seeds and their positions.

Another approach could be to consider the distance from each seed and assign values based on that.

For example, cells directly adjacent to a seed could be 5s, cells adjacent to two seeds could be 4s, and so on.

But in some examples, there are cells with 5s that are multiple steps away from the seed, not just directly adjacent.

Wait, in Example 5, the seed 6 is surrounded by 5s in a blob that extends beyond just the immediate neighbors.

So it's not just direct adjacency.

Maybe the 5s spread as far as possible without crossing into another seed's region.

Like watersheds in image processing, where each seed defines a basin, and the 5s are the basin fill, and 4s are the ridges between basins.

This seems promising.

So, in terms of watershed algorithms, each seed defines a region, and the boundaries between regions are set to a different value.

In this case, the basin is filled with 5s, and the boundaries with 4s.

But in some examples, there are cells with values other than 4 and 5, like 3s and 2s.

This suggests that the boundary handling is more complex.

Looking back at Example 2:

- Row 5, column 5 has a 4, which is between influences of 3 and 2.

- Row 6, column 5 has a 3, which might be where three influences meet.

So perhaps:

- Cells influenced by one seed: 5.

- Cells influenced by two seeds: 4.

- Cells influenced by three seeds: 3.

- And so on.

This seems plausible.

Similarly, in Example 4, row 5, column 5 has a 2, which might indicate influence by two seeds.

Wait, but in Example 4, row 5, column 5 is between seeds 2 and 3.

If it's between two seeds, why is it a 2 instead of a 4?

This inconsistency is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the boundary values are determined by the sum or average of the seeds' values.

But in Example 4, sum of 2 and 3 would be 5, but it's showing a 2.

This doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the boundary values are determined by the minimum or maximum of the adjacent seeds.

In Example 4, the minimum of 2 and 3 is 2, which matches the output.

In Example 2, between 3 and 2, the minimum is 2, but in the output, it's a 4.

Wait, this doesn't hold.

So my previous assumption is incorrect.

I need to find another pattern.

Looking back at the examples, perhaps the numbers 5 and 4 are not directly related to the seed values, but to their positions relative to the seeds.

Wait, in all examples, the seeds are replaced by 5s, and their adjacent cells are also often 5s, unless they are adjacent to another seed's region, in which case they are 4s.

So maybe:

- Perform a flood fill from each seed with 5s, spreading to adjacent cells.

- When flood fills from different seeds meet, place 4s in the boundary cells where their influences meet.

This could explain why in Example 5, which has only one seed, the entire influenced area is filled with 5s, and there are no 4s.

In Example 0, where there are two seeds, the flood fills meet, and 4s are placed in the boundary cells between them.

Similarly in other examples.

This seems like a consistent pattern.

So, to apply this to the test input:

- Identify all seeds: 1, 2, 6, and 3, at positions (2,1), (6,7), (7,5), and (7,9), respectively.

- Perform flood fill with 5s from each seed, spreading to adjacent cells.

- Where flood fills from different seeds meet, place 4s in the boundary cells.

But I need to define the exact rules for flood fill and boundary detection.

Assuming flood fill spreads to all connected cells not blocked by other seeds' influences.

In practice, this would involve growing regions from each seed until they meet other regions.

Where regions meet, mark those cells as boundaries with 4s.

I need to implement this logic step by step.

First, mark all seed cells as 5s.

Then, iteratively fill adjacent cells with 5s for each seed's region.

When a cell adjacent to two different regions is encountered, mark it as 4.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to sketch this out for the test input.

Test Input:

Row 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 2: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]

Row 7: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]

Row 8: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 9: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 10: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Seeds:

- Seed 1 at (2,1)

- Seed 2 at (6,7)

- Seed 6 at (7,5)

- Seed 3 at (7,9)

First, mark all seed cells as 5s:

Row 2: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]

Row 7: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]

Now, perform flood fill with 5s from each seed.

Starting with seed 1 at (2,1):

- Fill (2,1) with 5.

- Fill adjacent cells: (3,1), (2,2).

- Continue filling until blocked by another seed's region.

Similarly for seed 2 at (6,7):

- Fill (6,7) with 5.

- Fill adjacent cells: (5,7), (6,6), (6,8), (7,7).

- Continue filling.

For seed 6 at (7,5):

- Fill (7,5) with 5.

- Fill adjacent cells: (6,5), (7,4), (7,6).

- Continue filling.

For seed 3 at (7,9):

- Fill (7,9) with 5.

- Fill adjacent cells: (6,9), (7,8), (7,10).

- Continue filling.

As the regions grow, when they meet, mark the boundary cells with 4s.

This process is similar to growing regions in a watershed algorithm, where boundaries between regions are marked separately.

Given the complexity of manually simulating this for an 11x11 grid, I need to find a systematic way to determine the output.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler pattern or rule that I'm missing.

Looking back at the training examples, perhaps the numbers in the output are determined by the sum or some operation on the distances to the seeds.

But calculating distances for each cell to each seed and then determining the output based on that seems too involved for a manual solution.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers represent some kind of elevation or weight that combines in specific ways when regions overlap.

Given the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess based on the observed patterns.

From the training examples, it seems that:

- Seeds are replaced by 5s.

- Areas influenced by a single seed are filled with 5s.

- Boundaries where influences of two seeds meet are marked with 4s.

- In areas where three or more influences meet, lower numbers like 3s or 2s are used.

Applying this to the test input:

- Seeds at (2,1), (6,7), (7,5), and (7,9).

- Flood fill 5s from each seed.

- Where two regions meet, place 4s.

- Where three regions meet, place 3s, and so on.

Given this, I can attempt to construct the output grid accordingly.

However, without a clear algorithm to determine the exact placement of 4s and 3s, I might not get it perfectly right.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers in the output are determined by the maximum seed value affecting that cell minus the number of seeds affecting it.

For example:

- If only one seed affects a cell, output 5.

- If two seeds affect a cell, output 4.

- If three seeds affect a cell, output 3.

- And so on.

This could explain why in some examples, boundaries have 4s, and higher overlaps have lower numbers.

In Example 2, row 5, column 5 has a 4, which is between two seeds, and row 6, column 5 has a 3, which might be influenced by three seeds.

Similarly, in Example 4, row 5, column 5 has a 2, which could be influenced by two seeds.

This seems consistent.

Therefore, the general rule might be:

Output value = 5 - (number of seeds influencing the cell - 1)

Simplify:

- One seed: 5 - (1 - 1) = 5

- Two seeds: 5 - (2 - 1) = 4

- Three seeds: 5 - (3 - 1) = 3

- Four seeds: 5 - (4 - 1) = 2

- And so on.

This seems to match the observed outputs in the examples.

Therefore, the pattern is:

- Each cell is assigned a value based on the number of seeds that influence it.

- The value is calculated as: 6 - number of influencing seeds.

- However, in some cases, it might be 5 - (number of influencing seeds - 1), which simplifies to the same formula.

Wait, in Example 4, row 5, column 5 has a 2, which would correspond to four seeds influencing it, but there are only three seeds in that example.

Wait, in Example 4, seeds are 1, 2, and 3, but row 5, column 5 has a 2, which would suggest influence by four seeds, which isn't the case.

This inconsistency suggests that my formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the output value is the minimum seed value minus the number of influencing seeds.

But that doesn't align with the examples.

I need to think differently.

Another possibility is that the output values are based on the Manhattan distance to the seeds.

- Cells at distance 0 from a seed are set to 5.

- Cells at distance 1 from a seed are set to 5.

- Cells at distance 2 from a seed are set to 5, and so on, until they meet another seed's influence.

- Boundary cells where influences meet are set to 4.

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the output is based on the seed value minus the distance to the seed.

But in many cases, the output is 5, regardless of the seed value.

This suggests that the seed value is less important than its position in defining the regions.

Given the time constraints, I need to make an assumption and proceed.

Assuming that:

- Each seed spreads 5s to all cells in its region, defined as all cells closer to it than to any other seed.

- Boundaries between regions are set to 4.

- Areas where three or more regions meet are set to 3, and so on.

With this in mind, I'll attempt to construct the output for the test input.

Test Input:

Seeds:

- Seed 1 at (2,1)

- Seed 2 at (6,7)

- Seed 6 at (7,5)

- Seed 3 at (7,9)

I need to determine for each cell which seeds it is closer to, and assign values accordingly.

Given that, I can categorize each cell based on the number of seeds it is equally close to.

- If a cell is closest to only one seed, it's assigned 5.

- If it's equally close to two seeds, it's assigned 4.

- If it's equally close to three seeds, it's assigned 3.

- And so on.

To implement this, I can calculate for each cell the Manhattan distance to each seed and determine the number of seeds that are closest to it.

Then, based on the number of closest seeds, assign the value accordingly.

Let's try to apply this logic to the test input.

First, define the seeds and their positions:

- Seed A: (2,1)

- Seed B: (6,7)

- Seed C: (7,5)

- Seed D: (7,9)

For each cell (i,j), calculate the Manhattan distance to each seed:

Distance to A: |i - 2| + |j - 1|

Distance to B: |i - 6| + |j - 7|

Distance to C: |i - 7| + |j - 5|

Distance to D: |i - 7| + |j - 9|

Find the minimum distance for each cell.

If a cell has only one seed with that minimum distance, assign 5.

If it has two seeds with the same minimum distance, assign 4.

If it has three seeds with the same minimum distance, assign 3.

And so on.

This approach is similar to creating a Voronoi diagram based on Manhattan distances.

Given the grid size, calculating this manually would be time-consuming, but I can try to reason about it.

Let's consider some cells:

Take cell (0,0):

Distances:

- A: |0-2| + |0-1| = 2 + 1 = 3

- B: |0-6| + |0-7| = 6 + 7 = 13

- C: |0-7| + |0-5| = 7 + 5 = 12

- D: |0-7| + |0-9| = 7 + 9 = 16

Minimum distance is 3 to seed A. Only one seed at that distance.

Assign 5.

Cell (2,1): seed A, so assign 5.

Cell (6,7): seed B, so assign 5.

Cell (7,5): seed C, so assign 5.

Cell (7,9): seed D, so assign 5.

Now, consider a cell between seeds A and B, say (4,4):

Distances:

- A: |4-2| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5

- B: |4-6| + |4-7| = 2 + 3 = 5

- C: |4-7| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4

- D: |4-7| + |4-9| = 3 + 5 = 8

Minimum distance is 4 to seed C.

So, assign 5.

Wait, but it's closest to C with distance 4.

But seeds A and B are both at distance 5, which is higher.

So, only seed C influences this cell.

Assign 5.

Now, consider cell (5,3):

Distances:

- A: |5-2| + |3-1| = 3 + 2 = 5

- B: |5-6| + |3-7| = 1 + 4 = 5

- C: |5-7| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4

- D: |5-7| + |3-9| = 2 + 6 = 8

Minimum distance is 4 to seed C.

So, assign 5.

Now, consider cell (7,7):

Distances:

- A: |7-2| + |7-1| = 5 + 6 = 11

- B: |7-6| + |7-7| = 1 + 0 = 1

- C: |7-7| + |7-5| = 0 + 2 = 2

- D: |7-7| + |7-9| = 0 + 2 = 2

Minimum distance is 1 to seed B.

Only one seed at that distance.

Assign 5.

Now, consider cell (7,6):

Distances:

- A: |7-2| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10

- B: |7-6| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = 2

- C: |7-7| + |6-5| = 0 + 1 = 1

- D: |7-7| + |6-9| = 0 + 3 = 3

Minimum distance is 1 to seed C.

Only one seed at that distance.

Assign 5.

Now, consider cell (7,8):

Distances:

- A: |7-2| + |8-1| = 5 + 7 = 12

- B: |7-6| + |8-7| = 1 + 1 = 2

- C: |7-7| + |8-5| = 0 + 3 = 3

- D: |7-7| + |8-9| = 0 + 1 = 1

Minimum distance is 1 to seed D.

Only one seed at that distance.

Assign 5.

Now, consider cell (6,5):

Distances:

- A: |6-2| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8

- B: |6-6| + |5-7| = 0 + 2 = 2

- C: |6-7| + |5-5| = 1 + 0 = 1

- D: |6-7| + |5-9| = 1 + 4 = 5

Minimum distance is 1 to seed C.

Only one seed at that distance.

Assign 5.

Now, consider cell (6,6):

Distances:

- A: |6-2| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9

- B: |6-6| + |6-7| = 0 + 1 = 1

- C: |6-7| + |6-5| = 1 + 1 = 2

- D: |6-7| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4

Minimum distance is 1 to seed B.

Only one seed at that distance.

Assign 5.

Now, consider cell (6,8):

Distances:

- A: |6-2| + |8-1| = 4 + 7 = 11

- B: |6-6| + |8-7| = 0 + 1 = 1

- C: |6-7| + |8-5| = 1 + 3 = 4

- D: |6-7| + |8-9| = 1 + 1 = 2

Minimum distance is 1 to seed B.

Only one seed at that distance.

Assign 5.

Now, consider cell (5,5):

Distances:

It seems like I have several training examples that show input grids transforming into output grids. My goal is to figure out the pattern or rule that's being applied in these transformations so I can apply it to the test input.\n\nFirst, I need to carefully observe the changes from input to output in each example.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\n\n- A 10x10 grid mostly filled with 0s, except for a single 1 in row 4, column 3, and a 2 in row 7, column 5.\n\nOutput:\n\n- The 1 is now surrounded by 5s in rows 3 and 4, columns 3 to 5.\n\n- Similarly, the 2 is also surrounded by 5s.\n\n- There's a 5 between the 1 and the 2, and some other changes.\n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of spreading or filling in certain patterns.\n\nLet me look at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n\n- A 10x10 grid with a 3 in row 2, column 3, and a 1 in row 6, column 6.\n\nOutput:\n\n- The 3 is surrounded by 5s, and the 1 is also surrounded by 5s, with some overlapping in between.\n\nIt seems like whenever there's a number greater than 0, it's being used as a seed to fill in surrounding cells with 5s, and possibly interacting with other seeds.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n- A 10x10 grid with a 3 in row 2, column 4, a 2 in row 4, column 6, and a 1 in row 6, column 7.\n\nOutput:\n\n- The 3 is surrounded by 5s, the 2 by 5s, and the 1 by 5s, with some interactions where their influence overlaps.\n\n- In areas where multiple seeds' influences meet, there are numbers like 4 appearing.\n\nThis makes me think that different seeds have areas of influence, and where these areas overlap, specific rules apply to determine the output value.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n\n- An 11x11 grid with a 2 in row 4, column 5, a 6 in row 6, column 3, and a 1 in row 9, column 7.\n\nOutput:\n\n- The 2, 6, and 1 each have areas surrounded by 5s, and where their areas meet, there are 4s.\n\n- There's a diagonal pattern with 4s and 5s connecting different seeds.\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput:\n\n- An 11x11 grid with a 1 in row 2, column 3, a 2 in row 4, column 5, and a 3 in row 6, column 8.\n\nOutput:\n\n- Similar pattern: seeds surrounded by 5s, with interactions leading to 4s in overlapping areas.\n\nExample 5:\n\nInput:\n\n- A 9x9 grid with a 6 in row 7, column 4.\n\nOutput:\n\n- The 6 is surrounded by 5s in a kind of blob.\n\nFrom all these examples, it seems like the key elements are:\n\n- Seeds (numbers greater than 0) that influence their surroundings.\n\n- The influence spreads to adjacent cells, filling them with 5s.\n\n- When influences from different seeds meet, specific rules determine the values at the boundaries or overlaps.\n\nI need to define more precisely how these influences spread and interact.\n\nFirst, let's consider how the influence spreads from a seed.\n\nIn Example 5, there's only one seed, a 6 in row 7, column 4. In the output, this seed is surrounded by 5s in a sort of blob shape. It looks like the 5s are spreading out from the seed.\n\nLooking back at other examples, it seems that the 5s spread in a sort of region growing from each seed.\n\nBut in areas where two seeds' regions would overlap, there are 4s, and sometimes 3s or other numbers.\n\nWait, in Example 2, there's a 4 appearing where influences meet.\n\nWait, in Example 2, row 5, column 5 has a 4, which is between a 3 and a 2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 4, row 5, column 6 has a 2, which is between a 2 and a 3.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the numbers represent different things.\n\nLet me try to think differently.\n\nPerhaps the seeds are like points in a Voronoi diagram, where each seed has a region of influence consisting of all cells closer to it than to any other seed.\n\nIn such a case, the regions would be separated by boundaries where the distance to two seeds is equal.\n\nBut in these examples, it seems like the regions are spreading with 5s, and the boundaries have 4s.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, there are 4s, 5s, and even a 3 in the output.\n\nI need to find a consistent rule that applies across all examples.\n\nLet me consider the following hypothesis:\n\n- Each non-zero number in the input grid is a seed.\n\n- From each seed, 5s spread to adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically, not diagonally).\n\n- The original seed number is replaced by a 5.\n\n- When two spreading regions from different seeds meet, the boundary cells between them are set to 4.\n\n- If three or more regions meet at a point, it might be set to a different number, like 3 or less, but I need to check.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis against Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- Seeds are 1 and 2.\n\n- In the output, both are replaced by 5s, and surrounded by 5s.\n\n- Between them, there are 5s and a 4 where their regions meet.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- Seeds are 3 and 1.\n\n- Output shows 5s spreading from both, with 4s where they meet.\n\nAgain, consistent.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\n- Seeds are 3, 2, and 1.\n\n- Output shows 5s spreading from each, with 4s where two regions meet, and possibly 4s where three regions meet.\n\nWait, in row 5, column 5, there's a 4, which is between 3, 2, and possibly 1.\n\nHmm, maybe 4s are used where any two regions meet, and higher overlaps might have lower numbers, but it's not clearly decreasing.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\n- Seeds are 2, 6, and 1.\n\n- Output shows 5s spreading from each, with 4s where they meet.\n\n- There's a diagonal of 4s connecting different seeds.\n\nIn Example 4:\n\n- Seeds are 1, 2, and 3.\n\n- Output shows 5s from each, with 4s where they meet.\n\n- In row 5, column 5, there's a 2, which might indicate something different.\n\nWait, perhaps the number in the boundary cells is determined by the sum or some function of the seeds' values.\n\nWait, in Example 4, row 5, column 5 is a 2, but the seeds are 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the boundary cells take the minimum or maximum of the adjacent seeds.\n\nIn Example 4, row 5, column 5 is a 2, which is the value of one of the seeds.\n\nBut in other examples, boundaries have 4s, which aren't present in the input seeds.\n\nThis suggests that 4 is a special value for boundaries.\n\nWait, perhaps 4 is used specifically for boundaries between two seeds.\n\nIn Example 2, row 5, column 5 is a 4, which is between seeds 3 and 2.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, boundaries have 4s.\n\nSo maybe:\n\n- 5s spread from each seed.\n\n- Where two regions meet, place a 4.\n\n- The original seed cells are replaced by 5s.\n\nBut in Example 2, there are 4s not directly adjacent to seeds, like in row 6, column 5, which is a 3.\n\nWait, in Example 2, row 6, column 5 is a 3, which is surrounded by 4s and 5s.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the original seed value is preserved in some cells.\n\nWait, no, in most examples, seeds are replaced by 5s.\n\nIn Example 2, the 3 in row 2, column 4 is replaced by 5s in the output.\n\nWait, but in row 5, column 5, which is not a seed, is a 4.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of flood fill or region growing.\n\nLet me consider the following steps:\n\n1. Identify all seeds (cells with values greater than 0).\n\n2. For each seed, perform a flood fill with 5s to adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically), stopping at boundaries formed by other seeds.\n\n3. Where flood fills from different seeds meet, place 4s in the boundary cells.\n\nBut in some examples, there are higher numbers like 5s and lower numbers like 4s, and occasionally 3s or 2s.\n\nWait, maybe the numbers are being combined in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the number of seeds influencing a cell.\n\n- Cells influenced by one seed: 5.\n\n- Cells influenced by two seeds: 4.\n\n- Cells influenced by three seeds: 3.\n\n- And so on.\n\nBut in Example 4, there's a cell with a 2, which would suggest influence by two seeds, but in other examples, two-seed influences have 4s.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 5 represents cells influenced by a seed, and 4 represents boundaries.\n\nBut in some examples, there are cells with 4 that are not directly adjacent to seeds.\n\nI need a better approach.\n\nLet me consider the test input:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSeeds are 1 at row 2, column 1; 2 at row 6, column 7; 6 at row 7, column 5; and 3 at row 7, column 9.\n\nI need to apply the pattern I deduce from the training examples to this test input.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the following steps:\n\n1. Identify all seeds.\n\n2. For each seed, mark its cell and adjacent cells with 5s, but only if not blocked by other seeds.\n\n3. Where the influence of two seeds meets, place a 4.\n\n4. Continue this process until all cells are filled according to the rules.\n\nBut I need a more precise algorithm.\n\nLooking back at the examples, it seems that the 5s spread from seeds, and 4s are placed in cells where the influence of two different seeds meets.\n\nMoreover, in some cases, higher numbers like 5s are used in the regions, and lower numbers like 4s in the boundaries.\n\nI need to see if there's a consistent way to determine the output based on the input seeds and their positions.\n\nAnother approach could be to consider the distance from each seed and assign values based on that.\n\nFor example, cells directly adjacent to a seed could be 5s, cells adjacent to two seeds could be 4s, and so on.\n\nBut in some examples, there are cells with 5s that are multiple steps away from the seed, not just directly adjacent.\n\nWait, in Example 5, the seed 6 is surrounded by 5s in a blob that extends beyond just the immediate neighbors.\n\nSo it's not just direct adjacency.\n\nMaybe the 5s spread as far as possible without crossing into another seed's region.\n\nLike watersheds in image processing, where each seed defines a basin, and the 5s are the basin fill, and 4s are the ridges between basins.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nSo, in terms of watershed algorithms, each seed defines a region, and the boundaries between regions are set to a different value.\n\nIn this case, the basin is filled with 5s, and the boundaries with 4s.\n\nBut in some examples, there are cells with values other than 4 and 5, like 3s and 2s.\n\nThis suggests that the boundary handling is more complex.\n\nLooking back at Example 2:\n\n- Row 5, column 5 has a 4, which is between influences of 3 and 2.\n\n- Row 6, column 5 has a 3, which might be where three influences meet.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n- Cells influenced by one seed: 5.\n\n- Cells influenced by two seeds: 4.\n\n- Cells influenced by three seeds: 3.\n\n- And so on.\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 4, row 5, column 5 has a 2, which might indicate influence by two seeds.\n\nWait, but in Example 4, row 5, column 5 is between seeds 2 and 3.\n\nIf it's between two seeds, why is it a 2 instead of a 4?\n\nThis inconsistency is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the boundary values are determined by the sum or average of the seeds' values.\n\nBut in Example 4, sum of 2 and 3 would be 5, but it's showing a 2.\n\nThis doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the boundary values are determined by the minimum or maximum of the adjacent seeds.\n\nIn Example 4, the minimum of 2 and 3 is 2, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2, between 3 and 2, the minimum is 2, but in the output, it's a 4.\n\nWait, this doesn't hold.\n\nSo my previous assumption is incorrect.\n\nI need to find another pattern.\n\nLooking back at the examples, perhaps the numbers 5 and 4 are not directly related to the seed values, but to their positions relative to the seeds.\n\nWait, in all examples, the seeds are replaced by 5s, and their adjacent cells are also often 5s, unless they are adjacent to another seed's region, in which case they are 4s.\n\nSo maybe:\n\n- Perform a flood fill from each seed with 5s, spreading to adjacent cells.\n\n- When flood fills from different seeds meet, place 4s in the boundary cells where their influences meet.\n\nThis could explain why in Example 5, which has only one seed, the entire influenced area is filled with 5s, and there are no 4s.\n\nIn Example 0, where there are two seeds, the flood fills meet, and 4s are placed in the boundary cells between them.\n\nSimilarly in other examples.\n\nThis seems like a consistent pattern.\n\nSo, to apply this to the test input:\n\n- Identify all seeds: 1, 2, 6, and 3, at positions (2,1), (6,7), (7,5), and (7,9), respectively.\n\n- Perform flood fill with 5s from each seed, spreading to adjacent cells.\n\n- Where flood fills from different seeds meet, place 4s in the boundary cells.\n\nBut I need to define the exact rules for flood fill and boundary detection.\n\nAssuming flood fill spreads to all connected cells not blocked by other seeds' influences.\n\nIn practice, this would involve growing regions from each seed until they meet other regions.\n\nWhere regions meet, mark those cells as boundaries with 4s.\n\nI need to implement this logic step by step.\n\nFirst, mark all seed cells as 5s.\n\nThen, iteratively fill adjacent cells with 5s for each seed's region.\n\nWhen a cell adjacent to two different regions is encountered, mark it as 4.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nLet me try to sketch this out for the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 2: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 3: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 7: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0]\n\nRow 8: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 9: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 10: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSeeds:\n\n- Seed 1 at (2,1)\n\n- Seed 2 at (6,7)\n\n- Seed 6 at (7,5)\n\n- Seed 3 at (7,9)\n\nFirst, mark all seed cells as 5s:\n\nRow 2: [0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\nRow 7: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\nNow, perform flood fill with 5s from each seed.\n\nStarting with seed 1 at (2,1):\n\n- Fill (2,1) with 5.\n\n- Fill adjacent cells: (3,1), (2,2).\n\n- Continue filling until blocked by another seed's region.\n\nSimilarly for seed 2 at (6,7):\n\n- Fill (6,7) with 5.\n\n- Fill adjacent cells: (5,7), (6,6), (6,8), (7,7).\n\n- Continue filling.\n\nFor seed 6 at (7,5):\n\n- Fill (7,5) with 5.\n\n- Fill adjacent cells: (6,5), (7,4), (7,6).\n\n- Continue filling.\n\nFor seed 3 at (7,9):\n\n- Fill (7,9) with 5.\n\n- Fill adjacent cells: (6,9), (7,8), (7,10).\n\n- Continue filling.\n\nAs the regions grow, when they meet, mark the boundary cells with 4s.\n\nThis process is similar to growing regions in a watershed algorithm, where boundaries between regions are marked separately.\n\nGiven the complexity of manually simulating this for an 11x11 grid, I need to find a systematic way to determine the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a simpler pattern or rule that I'm missing.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, perhaps the numbers in the output are determined by the sum or some operation on the distances to the seeds.\n\nBut calculating distances for each cell to each seed and then determining the output based on that seems too involved for a manual solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers represent some kind of elevation or weight that combines in specific ways when regions overlap.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess based on the observed patterns.\n\nFrom the training examples, it seems that:\n\n- Seeds are replaced by 5s.\n\n- Areas influenced by a single seed are filled with 5s.\n\n- Boundaries where influences of two seeds meet are marked with 4s.\n\n- In areas where three or more influences meet, lower numbers like 3s or 2s are used.\n\nApplying this to the test input:\n\n- Seeds at (2,1), (6,7), (7,5), and (7,9).\n\n- Flood fill 5s from each seed.\n\n- Where two regions meet, place 4s.\n\n- Where three regions meet, place 3s, and so on.\n\nGiven this, I can attempt to construct the output grid accordingly.\n\nHowever, without a clear algorithm to determine the exact placement of 4s and 3s, I might not get it perfectly right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers in the output are determined by the maximum seed value affecting that cell minus the number of seeds affecting it.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If only one seed affects a cell, output 5.\n\n- If two seeds affect a cell, output 4.\n\n- If three seeds affect a cell, output 3.\n\n- And so on.\n\nThis could explain why in some examples, boundaries have 4s, and higher overlaps have lower numbers.\n\nIn Example 2, row 5, column 5 has a 4, which is between two seeds, and row 6, column 5 has a 3, which might be influenced by three seeds.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 4, row 5, column 5 has a 2, which could be influenced by two seeds.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the general rule might be:\n\nOutput value = 5 - (number of seeds influencing the cell - 1)\n\nSimplify:\n\n- One seed: 5 - (1 - 1) = 5\n\n- Two seeds: 5 - (2 - 1) = 4\n\n- Three seeds: 5 - (3 - 1) = 3\n\n- Four seeds: 5 - (4 - 1) = 2\n\n- And so on.\n\nThis seems to match the observed outputs in the examples.\n\nTherefore, the pattern is:\n\n- Each cell is assigned a value based on the number of seeds that influence it.\n\n- The value is calculated as: 6 - number of influencing seeds.\n\n- However, in some cases, it might be 5 - (number of influencing seeds - 1), which simplifies to the same formula.\n\nWait, in Example 4, row 5, column 5 has a 2, which would correspond to four seeds influencing it, but there are only three seeds in that example.\n\nWait, in Example 4, seeds are 1, 2, and 3, but row 5, column 5 has a 2, which would suggest influence by four seeds, which isn't the case.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my formula is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output value is the minimum seed value minus the number of influencing seeds.\n\nBut that doesn't align with the examples.\n\nI need to think differently.\n\nAnother possibility is that the output values are based on the Manhattan distance to the seeds.\n\n- Cells at distance 0 from a seed are set to 5.\n\n- Cells at distance 1 from a seed are set to 5.\n\n- Cells at distance 2 from a seed are set to 5, and so on, until they meet another seed's influence.\n\n- Boundary cells where influences meet are set to 4.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the seed value minus the distance to the seed.\n\nBut in many cases, the output is 5, regardless of the seed value.\n\nThis suggests that the seed value is less important than its position in defining the regions.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make an assumption and proceed.\n\nAssuming that:\n\n- Each seed spreads 5s to all cells in its region, defined as all cells closer to it than to any other seed.\n\n- Boundaries between regions are set to 4.\n\n- Areas where three or more regions meet are set to 3, and so on.\n\nWith this in mind, I'll attempt to construct the output for the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nSeeds:\n\n- Seed 1 at (2,1)\n\n- Seed 2 at (6,7)\n\n- Seed 6 at (7,5)\n\n- Seed 3 at (7,9)\n\nI need to determine for each cell which seeds it is closer to, and assign values accordingly.\n\nGiven that, I can categorize each cell based on the number of seeds it is equally close to.\n\n- If a cell is closest to only one seed, it's assigned 5.\n\n- If it's equally close to two seeds, it's assigned 4.\n\n- If it's equally close to three seeds, it's assigned 3.\n\n- And so on.\n\nTo implement this, I can calculate for each cell the Manhattan distance to each seed and determine the number of seeds that are closest to it.\n\nThen, based on the number of closest seeds, assign the value accordingly.\n\nLet's try to apply this logic to the test input.\n\nFirst, define the seeds and their positions:\n\n- Seed A: (2,1)\n\n- Seed B: (6,7)\n\n- Seed C: (7,5)\n\n- Seed D: (7,9)\n\nFor each cell (i,j), calculate the Manhattan distance to each seed:\n\nDistance to A: |i - 2| + |j - 1|\n\nDistance to B: |i - 6| + |j - 7|\n\nDistance to C: |i - 7| + |j - 5|\n\nDistance to D: |i - 7| + |j - 9|\n\nFind the minimum distance for each cell.\n\nIf a cell has only one seed with that minimum distance, assign 5.\n\nIf it has two seeds with the same minimum distance, assign 4.\n\nIf it has three seeds with the same minimum distance, assign 3.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThis approach is similar to creating a Voronoi diagram based on Manhattan distances.\n\nGiven the grid size, calculating this manually would be time-consuming, but I can try to reason about it.\n\nLet's consider some
