Raw model response:
I've got this puzzle to solve. It seems like there are some input and output arrays, and I need to figure out the pattern or transformation that turns the input into the output. Then, apply that same pattern to a new test input to get the final output.

First, I need to look at the training examples to understand what's going on.

In Example 0:

Input:

[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]

[1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]

[1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]

[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

Output:

[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]

[1, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]

[1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1]

[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

Comparing the input and output, I notice that in some positions, the value 3 changes to 8, and in some cases, multiple 3's are connected and change to 8.

In Example 1:

Input:

[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

[1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

[0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]

[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

[0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

Output:

[1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

[1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 1, 1, 3, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

[0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]

[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

[1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

[0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]

[0, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 1, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

Again, 3's are turning into 8's in certain positions, and it seems like they are connected in some way.

In Example 2:

Input:

[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

[0, 1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 1, 0]

[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 3]

[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0]

[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]

Output:

[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

[1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 3, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]

[0, 1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

[1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8]

[0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3, 8, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 8, 3]

[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0]

[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 3, 8, 8, 8, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 8, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]

Here, the same pattern continues where 3's are turning into 8's in connected groups.

From these examples, it seems like the transformation involves changing all 3's that are connected to each other horizontally or vertically to 8's, while leaving other 3's unchanged.

So, the rule is: Change all 3's that are part of a connected group (horizontally or vertically) to 8's, while keeping isolated 3's as they are.

Wait, but in the output, some 3's are still 3's, so maybe there's a condition based on their neighbors.

Looking back at Example 0:

In the input, there are 3's that are changed to 8's, but some 3's remain as 3's in the output.

For instance, in row 4:

Input: [0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here, the 3's at positions 2 and 5 are connected via the 1 in between, so they don't change, but according to the output, only the 3's at positions 2 and 5 are changed to 8's. Wait, no, in the output, position 4 is 8, but positions 2 and 5 are still 3's. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at it differently.

Maybe the transformation is to change all 1's that are between 3's to 8's, and then change the 3's themselves to 8's.

Wait, but in Example 0, row 4:

Input: [0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here, the 1 between two 3's is changed to 8.

Similarly, in row 5:

Input: [1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

Output: [1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

Here, the 1's between two 3's are changed to 8's.

Wait, but in row 10:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Here, the 1's are changed to 8's, but there are no 3's adjacent to them. Wait, there is a 3 at position 3, and the 1's next to it are changed to 8's, and then the 1's adjacent to those are also changed to 8's, propagating the change.

So, it seems like starting from a 3, all adjacent 1's (horizontally and vertically) are changed to 8's, and this propagates to all 1's connected to those 1's, similar to flooding or filling a region.

Similarly, in Example 1, row 3:

Input: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Output: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Here, the 0 between the 3 and the 1's doesn't connect them, so only the 3 is changed to 8, and the 1's adjacent to it are changed to 8's.

Wait, but in this case, the 1's are not connected to the 3 directly, so why are they changed to 8's? Maybe because the 0 doesn't block the connection.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of it as a flood fill, where 1's and 3's are considered part of the same region, and 0's are barriers.

So, starting from a 3, all connected 1's (through horizontal and vertical paths, not diagonally) are considered part of the same region and are changed to 8's, while 0's act as barriers.

Let me test this hypothesis with the first example.

In Example 0, row 4:

Input: [0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

According to my hypothesis, starting from the 3 at position 3, the 1 at position 4 is connected to it, so it becomes 8, and the 3 at position 5 is adjacent to the 8, so it also becomes 8. The 0 at position 6 blocks further connection.

Similarly, in row 5:

Input: [1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

Output: [1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

Here, starting from the 3 at position 2, the 1's at positions 3,4,5 are connected to it, so they become 8's, and the 3 at position 6 is adjacent to the 8's, so it becomes 8 as well. However, in the output, the 3 at position 6 is still 3, not 8. Wait, that contradicts my hypothesis.

Wait, perhaps only the 1's are changed to 8's, and the 3's remain 3's, but in some cases, 3's are also changed to 8's.

Looking back at Example 0, row 11:

Input: [1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]

Output: [1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1]

Here, the 1's around the 3 are changed to 8's, and the 3 remains 3.

Wait, but in row 4 of Example 0, the 3's are changed to 8's when they are adjacent to 8's.

I'm getting confused.

Maybe the rule is: Change all 1's that are connected to a 3 (through horizontal and vertical paths) to 8's, and change the 3's themselves to 8's if they are adjacent to at least one 8.

Wait, but in row 5 of Example 0, the 3's adjacent to 8's remain 3's.

This is tricky.

Perhaps a better approach is to perform a flood fill starting from each 3, changing connected 1's to 8's, and then change the original 3 to 8 if it is adjacent to any 8's.

Let's try applying this to row 4 of Example 0:

Input: [0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

- Start from the 3 at position 3:

- Change the 1 at position 4 to 8.

- The 3 at position 5 is adjacent to the 8, so change it to 8.

- The 0 at position 6 blocks further connection.

- So, the row becomes: [0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

But in the actual output, it's [0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

This doesn't match. Maybe my assumption is wrong.

Alternative approach: Perhaps only the 1's connected to 3's are changed to 8's, and the 3's remain as they are, unless they are surrounded by 8's.

But in row 4 of Example 0, the output has the 3's remaining as 3's, but in row 11 of Example 0, the 3 is surrounded by 8's and still remains as 3.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the 3's are only changed to 8's if they are directly adjacent to an 8.

In row 4 of Example 0:

Output: [0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here, the 3 at position 3 is adjacent to the 8 at position 5, so it should be changed to 8, but in the output, it remains 3.

Wait, maybe the rule is different.

Looking at Example 1, row 5:

Input: [1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Output: [1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Here, the 3 is adjacent to 8's but remains 3.

In Example 2, row 9:

Input: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8]

Output: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8]

Again, the 3 is adjacent to 8's but remains 3.

So, perhaps the rule is: Change all 1's that are connected to a 3 (through horizontal and vertical paths) to 8's, but leave the 3's as they are.

But in Example 0, row 4:

Input: [0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here, the 1 between two 3's is changed to 8, which fits the rule.

Wait, but in row 5:

Input: [1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

Output: [1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

Here, the 1's connected to the 3 are changed to 8's, and the 3 remains 3.

Similarly, in row 11:

Input: [0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]

Again, the 1's connected to the 3 are changed to 8's, and the 3 remains 3.

So, the rule seems to be: Perform a flood fill starting from each 3, changing all connected 1's to 8's, but leave the 3's unchanged.

However, in row 4 of Example 0, the output shows the 3's adjacent to the 8's are still 3's, which matches.

In Example 1, row 3:

Input: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Output: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Here, the 1 adjacent to the 3 is changed to 8, and the rest of the 1's are not changed because they are not connected through a path of 1's to the 3.

Wait, but there is a 0 between the 3 and the 1's, so they are not connected, but in the output, only the single 1 adjacent to the 3 is changed to 8.

This suggests that only directly adjacent 1's to the 3 are changed to 8's, not all connected 1's through a path.

Wait, but in row 5 of Example 0, the 1's connected through other 1's are all changed to 8's.

This is inconsistent with the previous observation.

Wait, perhaps the connection is only through horizontal and vertical paths without any 0's blocking.

In row 3 of Example 1:

Input: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Output: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Here, the 0 at position 6 blocks the connection between the 3 and the 1's, so only the directly adjacent 1 at position 7 is changed to 8.

In row 5 of Example 0:

Input: [1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

Output: [1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

Here, the 1's form a connected path from the first 3 to the second 3, so all connected 1's are changed to 8's.

So, the rule seems to be: For each 3, perform a flood fill to change all horizontally and vertically connected 1's to 8's, including those connected through other 1's, but do not change the 3's themselves.

However, in row 4 of Example 0:

Input: [0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Output: [0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here, the 1 between the two 3's is changed to 8, which fits the rule.

But according to this rule, in row 3 of Example 1:

Input: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Output: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Only the directly adjacent 1 to the 3 is changed to 8, because the 0 blocks the connection to the other 1's.

This seems consistent.

So, the transformation rule is:

- For each 3 in the array, perform a flood fill to change all horizontally and vertically connected 1's to 8's, starting from that 3.

- Do not change the 3's themselves.

- If multiple 3's are present, their flood fills can overlap, and all 1's in the connected region are changed to 8's.

This explains why in some cases, 3's are adjacent to 8's but remain as 3's.

Now, I need to apply this rule to the test input.

Test Input:

[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

[1, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

I need to process each row separately, identifying the positions of 3's and performing a flood fill to change connected 1's to 8's.

I'll go through each row one by one.

continues where 3's are turning into 8's in connected groups.\n\nFrom these examples, it seems like the transformation involves changing all 3's that are connected to each other horizontally or vertically to 8's, while leaving other 3's unchanged.\n\nSo, the rule is: Change all 3's that are part of a connected group (horizontally or vertically) to 8's, while keeping isolated 3's as they are.\n\nWait, but in the output, some 3's are still 3's, so maybe there's a condition based on their neighbors.\n\nLooking back at Example 0:\n\nIn the input, there are 3's that are changed to 8's, but some 3's remain as 3's in the output.\n\nFor instance, in row 4:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, the 3's at positions 2 and 5 are connected via the 1 in between, so they don't change, but according to the output, only the 3's at positions 2 and 5 are changed to 8's. Wait, no, in the output, position 4 is 8, but positions 2 and 5 are still 3's. Hmm, that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at it differently.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to change all 1's that are between 3's to 8's, and then change the 3's themselves to 8's.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, row 4:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, the 1 between two 3's is changed to 8.\n\nSimilarly, in row 5:\n\nInput: [1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nOutput: [1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nHere, the 1's between two 3's are changed to 8's.\n\nWait, but in row 10:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nHere, the 1's are changed to 8's, but there are no 3's adjacent to them. Wait, there is a 3 at position 3, and the 1's next to it are changed to 8's, and then the 1's adjacent to those are also changed to 8's, propagating the change.\n\nSo, it seems like starting from a 3, all adjacent 1's (horizontally and vertically) are changed to 8's, and this propagates to all 1's connected to those 1's, similar to flooding or filling a region.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, row 3:\n\nInput: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nOutput: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nHere, the 0 between the 3 and the 1's doesn't connect them, so only the 3 is changed to 8, and the 1's adjacent to it are changed to 8's.\n\nWait, but in this case, the 1's are not connected to the 3 directly, so why are they changed to 8's? Maybe because the 0 doesn't block the connection.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of it as a flood fill, where 1's and 3's are considered part of the same region, and 0's are barriers.\n\nSo, starting from a 3, all connected 1's (through horizontal and vertical paths, not diagonally) are considered part of the same region and are changed to 8's, while 0's act as barriers.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the first example.\n\nIn Example 0, row 4:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAccording to my hypothesis, starting from the 3 at position 3, the 1 at position 4 is connected to it, so it becomes 8, and the 3 at position 5 is adjacent to the 8, so it also becomes 8. The 0 at position 6 blocks further connection.\n\nSimilarly, in row 5:\n\nInput: [1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nOutput: [1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nHere, starting from the 3 at position 2, the 1's at positions 3,4,5 are connected to it, so they become 8's, and the 3 at position 6 is adjacent to the 8's, so it becomes 8 as well. However, in the output, the 3 at position 6 is still 3, not 8. Wait, that contradicts my hypothesis.\n\nWait, perhaps only the 1's are changed to 8's, and the 3's remain 3's, but in some cases, 3's are also changed to 8's.\n\nLooking back at Example 0, row 11:\n\nInput: [1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]\n\nOutput: [1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1]\n\nHere, the 1's around the 3 are changed to 8's, and the 3 remains 3.\n\nWait, but in row 4 of Example 0, the 3's are changed to 8's when they are adjacent to 8's.\n\nI'm getting confused.\n\nMaybe the rule is: Change all 1's that are connected to a 3 (through horizontal and vertical paths) to 8's, and change the 3's themselves to 8's if they are adjacent to at least one 8.\n\nWait, but in row 5 of Example 0, the 3's adjacent to 8's remain 3's.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to perform a flood fill starting from each 3, changing connected 1's to 8's, and then change the original 3 to 8 if it is adjacent to any 8's.\n\nLet's try applying this to row 4 of Example 0:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n- Start from the 3 at position 3:\n\n- Change the 1 at position 4 to 8.\n\n- The 3 at position 5 is adjacent to the 8, so change it to 8.\n\n- The 0 at position 6 blocks further connection.\n\n- So, the row becomes: [0, 0, 1, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nBut in the actual output, it's [0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nThis doesn't match. Maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps only the 1's connected to 3's are changed to 8's, and the 3's remain as they are, unless they are surrounded by 8's.\n\nBut in row 4 of Example 0, the output has the 3's remaining as 3's, but in row 11 of Example 0, the 3 is surrounded by 8's and still remains as 3.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the 3's are only changed to 8's if they are directly adjacent to an 8.\n\nIn row 4 of Example 0:\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, the 3 at position 3 is adjacent to the 8 at position 5, so it should be changed to 8, but in the output, it remains 3.\n\nWait, maybe the rule is different.\n\nLooking at Example 1, row 5:\n\nInput: [1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nOutput: [1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nHere, the 3 is adjacent to 8's but remains 3.\n\nIn Example 2, row 9:\n\nInput: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8]\n\nOutput: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8]\n\nAgain, the 3 is adjacent to 8's but remains 3.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is: Change all 1's that are connected to a 3 (through horizontal and vertical paths) to 8's, but leave the 3's as they are.\n\nBut in Example 0, row 4:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, the 1 between two 3's is changed to 8, which fits the rule.\n\nWait, but in row 5:\n\nInput: [1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nOutput: [1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nHere, the 1's connected to the 3 are changed to 8's, and the 3 remains 3.\n\nSimilarly, in row 11:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n\nAgain, the 1's connected to the 3 are changed to 8's, and the 3 remains 3.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: Perform a flood fill starting from each 3, changing all connected 1's to 8's, but leave the 3's unchanged.\n\nHowever, in row 4 of Example 0, the output shows the 3's adjacent to the 8's are still 3's, which matches.\n\nIn Example 1, row 3:\n\nInput: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nOutput: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nHere, the 1 adjacent to the 3 is changed to 8, and the rest of the 1's are not changed because they are not connected through a path of 1's to the 3.\n\nWait, but there is a 0 between the 3 and the 1's, so they are not connected, but in the output, only the single 1 adjacent to the 3 is changed to 8.\n\nThis suggests that only directly adjacent 1's to the 3 are changed to 8's, not all connected 1's through a path.\n\nWait, but in row 5 of Example 0, the 1's connected through other 1's are all changed to 8's.\n\nThis is inconsistent with the previous observation.\n\nWait, perhaps the connection is only through horizontal and vertical paths without any 0's blocking.\n\nIn row 3 of Example 1:\n\nInput: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nOutput: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nHere, the 0 at position 6 blocks the connection between the 3 and the 1's, so only the directly adjacent 1 at position 7 is changed to 8.\n\nIn row 5 of Example 0:\n\nInput: [1, 0, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nOutput: [1, 0, 3, 8, 8, 8, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]\n\nHere, the 1's form a connected path from the first 3 to the second 3, so all connected 1's are changed to 8's.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be: For each 3, perform a flood fill to change all horizontally and vertically connected 1's to 8's, including those connected through other 1's, but do not change the 3's themselves.\n\nHowever, in row 4 of Example 0:\n\nInput: [0, 0, 1, 3, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput: [0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nHere, the 1 between the two 3's is changed to 8, which fits the rule.\n\nBut according to this rule, in row 3 of Example 1:\n\nInput: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nOutput: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nOnly the directly adjacent 1 to the 3 is changed to 8, because the 0 blocks the connection to the other 1's.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nSo, the transformation rule is:\n\n- For each 3 in the array, perform a flood fill to change all horizontally and vertically connected 1's to 8's, starting from that 3.\n\n- Do not change the 3's themselves.\n\n- If multiple 3's are present, their flood fills can overlap, and all 1's in the connected region are changed to 8's.\n\nThis explains why in some cases, 3's are adjacent to 8's but remain as 3's.\n\nNow, I need to apply this rule to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1,
