Raw model response:
As an expert puzzle solver, I need to identify the pattern or transformation that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs in the training examples, and then apply that same pattern to the test input to produce the final output.

First, I'll carefully examine the training examples to understand the transformation.

**Training Example 0:**

**Input:**

- A grid of numbers with various values, mostly zeros, and some regions with numbers like 4, 5, 8, and 3.

**Output:**

- The output seems to have expanded or filled in certain regions with the numbers from the input.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that in the output, the numbers have spread or propagated to adjacent cells in a particular way.

**Observations:**

1. The number 5 remains unchanged at the bottom row.

2. The number 8 in the 7th row has propagated to the cells below it, filling the column with 8 up to the row where 4s start.

3. The number 4 in the 4th row has propagated downwards, filling the column with 4 until it meets the 3s below.

4. The number 3 in the 12th row has propagated upwards and downwards, filling the column with 3s.

It seems like the numbers are spreading downwards, filling the columns below them until they encounter another number.

**Training Example 1:**

**Input:**

- Another grid with different placements of numbers.

**Output:**

- Similar propagation of numbers downwards, filling columns until they meet another number.

**Observations:**

1. The number 5 remains at the end of each row.

2. The number 2 in the 2nd and 3rd rows has propagated to fill the column with 2s until it meets the 3s below.

3. The number 3 in the 5th to 7th rows has propagated downwards, filling the column with 3s until it meets the 7s above.

4. The number 7 in the 8th to 11th rows has propagated upwards and downwards, filling the column with 7s.

This reinforces the idea that numbers propagate downwards, filling columns until they encounter another number.

**Training Example 2:**

**Input:**

- Yet another grid with different placements.

**Output:**

- Again, numbers propagate downwards, filling columns until they meet another number.

**Observations:**

1. The number 5 remains at the start of each row.

2. The number 3 in the 2nd to 5th rows has propagated to fill the column with 3s until it meets the 6s below.

3. The number 6 in the 6th and 7th rows has propagated upwards and downwards, filling the column with 6s.

4. The number 2 in the 11th and 12th rows has propagated to fill the column with 2s until it meets the 6s above.

This consistent behavior across all training examples suggests that the transformation involves downward propagation of numbers, filling columns until another number is encountered.

**General Pattern:**

- Starting from the top of each column, whenever a non-zero number is encountered, it propagates downwards, filling all cells below it with its value, until another non-zero number is encountered in the same column.

- The bottom row seems to have a boundary effect, where the number (like 5) remains unchanged.

- The propagation seems to happen column-wise, independent of the rows.

**Applying the Pattern to the Test Input:**

Given the test input grid, I need to apply the same transformation:

1. Examine each column from top to bottom.

2. When a non-zero number is encountered, fill all the cells below it in the same column with that number until another non-zero number is encountered.

Let's apply this step by step to the test input.

**Test Input:**

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

**Step-by-step Transformation:**

1. **First Column:**

- Starts with 5, propagates downwards to the end.

- Result: All cells in the first column are 5.

2. **Second Column:**

- Starts with 5, propagates downwards to the end.

- Result: All cells in the second column are 5.

...

- This pattern continues for columns 1 to 15.

3. **Sixteenth Column:**

- Starts with 5, then 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

- The first non-zero is 5, propagates downwards until 8 is encountered.

- Then 8 propagates downwards to the end.

- Result: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,8,8,8]

4. **Seventeenth Column:**

- Starts with 5, then 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

- Similar to the sixteenth column.

- Result: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,8,8,8]

5. **Eighteenth Column:**

- Starts with 5, then 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.

- The first non-zero is 5, propagates downwards to the end.

- Result: All cells in the eighteenth column are 5.

**Final Output Grid:**

After applying the propagation rule to each column, the final output grid should look like this:

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,8,8,5]

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,8,8,5]

[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,5]

[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,5]

[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,5]

[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,5]

[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,8,8,8,5]

[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,8,8,8,5]

[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,8,8,8,5]

[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,8,8,8,5]

[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,5]

[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,5]

[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,5]

[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,5]

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to identify and apply a specific pattern or transformation to the given input grid to produce the desired output. The transformation involves propagating non-zero values downward in each column until another non-zero value is encountered.

### Approach

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Observe that in the output, non-zero values from the input grid propagate downward in their respective columns until they meet another non-zero value.
   - This suggests that each column is processed independently, filling downward with the last seen non-zero value until a new one is found.

2. **Process Each Column:**
   - For each column, iterate from the top to the bottom.
   - Keep track of the last non-zero value encountered.
   - Fill each cell in the column with the last seen non-zero value until a new non-zero value is found.

3. **Implement the Transformation:**
   - Transpose the input grid to facilitate column-wise operations.
   - Process each column (now a row after transposition) to apply the propagation logic.
   - Transpose the result back to the original grid format.

### Solution Code

```python
def propagate_values(grid):
    # Transpose the grid to handle columns easily
    transposed = list(zip(*grid))
    
    # Function to propagate in a single column
    def propagate(column):
        last_value = None
        propagated = []
        for val in column:
            if val != 0:
                last_value = val
            if last_value is not None:
                propagated.append(last_value)
            else:
                propagated.append(0)
        return propagated
    
    # Apply propagation to each column
    propagated_transposed = [propagate(col) for col in transposed]
    
    # Transpose back to original grid format
    result = [list(row) for row in zip(*propagated_transposed)]
    return result

# Example usage
input_grid = [
    [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
]

output_grid = propagate_values(input_grid)
for row in output_grid:
    print(row)
```

### Explanation

- **Transpose the Grid:** This allows us to work column-wise by treating columns as rows.
- **Propagate Values:** For each column (now a row after transposition), track the last non-zero value and fill downwards.
- **Transpose Back:** Convert the processed columns back to the original grid format to get the final output.

This method ensures that the transformation is applied correctly according to the observed pattern in the training examples.

additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})], 'next_step': 'generate', 'current_response': "As an expert puzzle solver, I need to identify the pattern or transformation that maps the given inputs to their corresponding outputs in the training examples, and then apply that same pattern to the test input to produce the final output.\n\nFirst, I'll carefully examine the training examples to understand the transformation.\n\n**Training Example 0:**\n\n**Input:**\n\n- A grid of numbers with various values, mostly zeros, and some regions with numbers like 4, 5, 8, and 3.\n\n**Output:**\n\n- The output seems to have expanded or filled in certain regions with the numbers from the input.\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that in the output, the numbers have spread or propagated to adjacent cells in a particular way.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n1. The number 5 remains unchanged at the bottom row.\n\n2. The number 8 in the 7th row has propagated to the cells below it, filling the column with 8 up to the row where 4s start.\n\n3. The number 4 in the 4th row has propagated downwards, filling the column with 4 until it meets the 3s below.\n\n4. The number 3 in the 12th row has propagated upwards and downwards, filling the column with 3s.\n\nIt seems like the numbers are spreading downwards, filling the columns below them until they encounter another number.\n\n**Training Example 1:**\n\n**Input:**\n\n- Another grid with different placements of numbers.\n\n**Output:**\n\n- Similar propagation of numbers downwards, filling columns until they meet another number.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n1. The number 5 remains at the end of each row.\n\n2. The number 2 in the 2nd and 3rd rows has propagated to fill the column with 2s until it meets the 3s below.\n\n3. The number 3 in the 5th to 7th rows has propagated downwards, filling the column with 3s until it meets the 7s above.\n\n4. The number 7 in the 8th to 11th rows has propagated upwards and downwards, filling the column with 7s.\n\nThis reinforces the idea that numbers propagate downwards, filling columns until they encounter another number.\n\n**Training Example 2:**\n\n**Input:**\n\n- Yet another grid with different placements.\n\n**Output:**\n\n- Again, numbers propagate downwards, filling columns until they meet another number.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n1. The number 5 remains at the start of each row.\n\n2. The number 3 in the 2nd to 5th rows has propagated to fill the column with 3s until it meets the 6s below.\n\n3. The number 6 in the 6th and 7th rows has propagated upwards and downwards, filling the column with 6s.\n\n4. The number 2 in the 11th and 12th rows has propagated to fill the column with 2s until it meets the 6s above.\n\nThis consistent behavior across all training examples suggests that the transformation involves downward propagation of numbers, filling columns until another number is encountered.\n\n**General Pattern:**\n\n- Starting from the top of each column, whenever a non-zero number is encountered, it propagates downwards, filling all cells below it with its value, until another non-zero number is encountered in the same column.\n\n- The bottom row seems to have a boundary effect, where the number (like 5) remains unchanged.\n\n- The propagation seems to happen column-wise, independent of the rows.\n\n**Applying the Pattern to the Test Input:**\n\nGiven the test input grid, I need to apply the same transformation:\n\n1. Examine each column from top to bottom.\n\n2. When a non-zero number is encountered, fill all the cells below it in the same column with that number until another non-zero number is encountered.\n\nLet's apply this step by step to the test input.\n\n**Test Input:**\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n**Step-by-step Transformation:**\n\n1. **First Column:**\n\n- Starts with 5, propagates downwards to the end.\n\n- Result: All cells in the first column are 5.\n\n2. **Second Column:**\n\n- Starts with 5, propagates downwards to the end.\n\n- Result: All cells in the second column are 5.\n\n...\n\n- This pattern continues for columns 1 to 15.\n\n3. **Sixteenth Column:**\n\n- Starts with 5, then 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.\n\n- The first non-zero is 5, propagates downwards until 8 is encountered.\n\n- Then 8 propagates downwards to the end.\n\n- Result: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,8,8,8]\n\n4. **Seventeenth Column:**\n\n- Starts with 5, then 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.\n\n- Similar to the sixteenth column.\n\n- Result: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,8,8,8]\n\n5. **Eighteenth Column:**\n\n- Starts with 5, then 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.\n\n- The first non-zero is 5, propagates downwards to the end.\n\n- Result: All cells in the eighteenth column are 5.\n\n**Final Output Grid:**\n\nAfter applying the propagation rule to each column, the final output grid should look like this:\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,8,8,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,8,8,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,8,8,8,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,8,8,8,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,8,8,8,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,8,8,8,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,4,8,8,8,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,5]\n\n[5,5,5,5,4,4,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,4,8,8,8,5]\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify and apply a specific pattern or transformation to the given input grid to produce the desired output. The transformation involves propagating non-zero values downward in each column until another non-zero value is encountered.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Observe that in the output, non-zero values from the input grid propagate downward in their respective columns until they meet another non-zero value.\n   - This suggests that each column is processed independently, filling downward with the last seen non-zero value until a new one is found.\n\n2. **Process Each Column:**\n   - For each column, iterate from the top to the bottom.\n   - Keep track of the last non-zero value encountered.\n   - Fill each cell in the column with the last seen non-zero value until a new non-zero value is found.\n\n3. **Implement the Transformation:**\n   - Transpose the input grid to facilitate column-wise operations.\n   - Process each column (now a row after transposition) to apply the propagation logic.\n   - Transpose the result back to the original grid format.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef propagate_values(grid):\n    # Transpose the grid to handle columns easily\n    transposed = list(zip(*grid))\n    \n    # Function to propagate in a single column\n    def propagate(column):\n        last_value = None\n        propagated = []\n        for val in column:\n            if val != 0:\n                last_value = val\n            if last_value is not None:\n                propagated.append(last_value)\n            else:\n                propagated.append(0)\n        return propagated\n    \n    # Apply propagation to each column\n    propagated_transposed = [propagate(col) for col in transposed]\n    \n    # Transpose back to original grid format\n    result = [list(row) for row in zip(*propagated_transposed)]\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\ninput_grid = [\n    [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n]\n\noutput_grid = propagate_values(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Transpose the Grid:** This allows us to work column-wise by treating columns as rows.\n- **Propagate Values:** For each column (now a row after transposition), track the last non-zero value and fill downwards.\n- **Transpose Back:** Convert the processed columns back to the original grid format to get the final output.\n\nThis method ensures that the transformation is applied correctly according to the observed pattern in the training examples.", 'final_json': None, 'retries': 0, 'task_id': '20241222_224646'}
