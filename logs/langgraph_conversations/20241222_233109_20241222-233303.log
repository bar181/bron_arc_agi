Raw model response:
I'm going to try to solve this puzzle. Let's look at the training examples first to understand the pattern.

In Example 0:

Input:

- A 12x12 grid of numbers.

- The grid has some non-zero numbers arranged in a certain pattern.

Output:

- A 4x4 grid.

- It seems like the output is a cropped version of the input grid, focusing on a specific section.

Looking at the input grid in Example 0, I notice that the non-zero numbers are clustered in the center of the grid, while the outer rows and columns are mostly zeros.

Similarly, in Example 1:

Input:

- Again, a 12x12 grid with non-zero numbers clustered in the center.

Output:

- A 4x4 grid that appears to be a cropped version of the central part of the input grid.

In Example 2:

Input:

- A 12x12 grid with a similar pattern, non-zero numbers in the center.

Output:

- A 4x4 grid that seems to capture the core section of the input grid.

From these examples, it seems like the task is to identify the smallest bounding box that encompasses all the non-zero elements in the input grid and output that subsection.

Let me verify this hypothesis with the training examples.

In Example 0:

- The non-zero elements are between rows 2 to 5 and columns 2 to 5.

- So, output is a 4x4 grid from row 2 to 5 and column 2 to 5.

Similarly, in Example 1:

- Non-zero elements are between rows 2 to 5 and columns 5 to 8.

- Output is a 4x4 grid from row 2 to 5 and column 5 to 8.

In Example 2:

- Non-zero elements are between rows 4 to 7 and columns 5 to 8.

- Output is a 4x4 grid from row 4 to 7 and column 5 to 8.

So, the pattern is to find the minimal bounding box that includes all non-zero elements and extract that as the output.

Now, applying this to the test input:

Test Input:

[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 8, 8, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 8, 8, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 8, 8, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 8, 8, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

First, identify the rows and columns that contain non-zero elements.

Looking at rows:

- Row 0: has non-zero elements (1,5,5,1)

- Row 1: has non-zero elements (5,3,8,8,3,5)

- Row 2: has non-zero elements (3,2,8,8,2,3)

- Row 3: has non-zero elements (5,8,8,6,6,8,8,5)

- Row 4: has non-zero elements (5,8,8,6,6,8,8,5)

- Row 5: has non-zero elements (3,2,8,8,2,3)

- Row 6: has non-zero elements (5,3,8,8,3,5)

- Row 7: has non-zero elements (1,5,5,1)

Rows 8-11 are all zeros, so the non-zero rows are from 0 to 7.

Now, looking at columns:

- Column 2: has non-zero elements in rows 0-7

- Column 3: has non-zero elements in rows 1-7

- Column 4: has non-zero elements in rows 1-7

- Column 5: has non-zero elements in rows 0-7

- Column 6: has non-zero elements in rows 0-7

- Column 7: has non-zero elements in rows 1-7

- Column 8: has non-zero elements in rows 0-7

- Column 9: has non-zero elements in rows 0-7

Columns 0,1,10,11 are all zeros.

So, the minimal bounding box is from row 0 to 7 and column 2 to 9.

However, in the training examples, the output was always 4x4. But in this test input, the bounding box is 8x8.

Wait, but looking back at the training examples:

- Example 0: input is 12x12, output is 4x4

- Example 1: input is 12x12, output is 4x4

- Example 2: input is 12x12, output is 4x4

But in this test input, if I follow the same logic, the output should be 8x8.

But perhaps there's a different pattern.

Let me consider that in all training examples, the output is 4x4, maybe the task is always to output a 4x4 grid from the center of the non-zero elements.

In Example 0:

- Non-zero section is from row 2 to 5, column 2 to 5: that's 4 rows and 4 columns.

In Example 1:

- Non-zero section is from row 2 to 5, column 5 to 8: 4x4

In Example 2:

- Non-zero section is from row 4 to 7, column 5 to 8: 4x4

So perhaps the task is always to find a 4x4 section.

But in the test input, the non-zero section is 8x8, which is larger than 4x4.

Maybe I need to find the center 4x4 section in the non-zero area.

In the test input, the non-zero section is from row 0 to 7, column 2 to 9: 8x8 grid.

The center 4x4 would be from row 2 to 5, column 4 to 7.

Let's extract that:

Row 2: columns 4 to 7: [2,8,8,2]

Row 3: columns 4 to 7: [8,8,6,6]

Row 4: columns 4 to 7: [8,8,6,6]

Row 5: columns 4 to 7: [2,8,8,2]

So the output should be:

[[2,8,8,2],

 [8,8,6,6],

 [8,8,6,6],

 [2,8,8,2]]

But wait, in the training examples, the output was always 4x4, but in this case, if I extract 4x4 from the center, it matches the pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different pattern altogether.

Looking back at the training examples:

In Example 0:

Input is symmetric, and output is the central 4x4.

Similarly in Example 1 and Example 2.

In the test input, it also seems symmetric, so extracting the central 4x4 should be appropriate.

Alternatively, maybe it's always a 4x4 grid from the center of the non-zero elements.

Given that, for the test input, rows 0 to 7 and columns 2 to 9 have non-zero elements, so center rows would be rows 2 to 5 and center columns would be 4 to 7.

So, output should be:

[[2,8,8,2],

 [8,8,6,6],

 [8,8,6,6],

 [2,8,8,2]]

But let's see if there's another pattern.

Looking at the training examples again:

In Example 0:

Input is a 12x12 grid with a 4x4 non-zero center.

Output is that 4x4 grid.

In Example 1:

Input is a 12x12 grid with a 4x4 non-zero center in a different position.

Output is that 4x4 grid.

In Example 2:

Similarly, a 4x4 non-zero center in a different position.

Output is that 4x4 grid.

In the test input, the non-zero section is larger, 8x8.

Perhaps the task is to find the innermost 4x4 grid.

Alternatively, maybe it's to find the smallest square that contains all the non-zero elements.

But in the training examples, the non-zero sections were already 4x4.

Given that, perhaps the task is simply to find and extract a 4x4 section from the input grid based on certain rules.

Alternatively, perhaps the output is a downsampled version of the input grid, keeping only every nth row and column.

But in the training examples, the input is 12x12 and output is 4x4, which would correspond to keeping every third row and column.

But in the test input, if I take every third row and column, starting from row 0 and column 0, I get:

Row 0, columns 0,3,6,9:

[0,0,0,0]

Row 3, columns 0,3,6,9:

[0,8,6,3]

Row 6, columns 0,3,6,9:

[0,8,6,3]

Row 9, columns 0,3,6,9:

[0,0,0,0]

Which doesn't match any of the patterns in the training examples.

Alternatively, starting from row 1, column 1:

Row 1, columns 1,4,7,10:

[0,3,3,0]

Row 4, columns 1,4,7,10:

[0,3,3,0]

Row 7, columns 1,4,7,10:

[0,3,3,0]

Row 10, columns 1,4,7,10:

[0,0,0,0]

Still not matching.

Perhaps downsampling isn't the right approach.

Let me consider another angle.

Looking back at the training examples, the output seems to be a cropped and possibly transformed version of the input.

In Example 0:

Input has a 4x4 non-zero section from row 2 to 5, column 2 to 5.

Output is exactly that section.

In Example 1:

Input has a 4x4 non-zero section from row 2 to 5, column 5 to 8.

Output is that section.

In Example 2:

Input has a 4x4 non-zero section from row 4 to 7, column 5 to 8.

Output is that section.

In the test input, the non-zero section is larger, from row 0 to 7, column 2 to 9.

Perhaps the task is to find the minimal bounding box that contains all non-zero elements and then crop that section.

But in the training examples, it's always 4x4, but in the test input, it would be 8x8.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a specific pattern in the arrangement of numbers.

Looking at the test input:

Rows 0 and 7 are similar: [0,0,1,0,0,5,5,0,0,1,0,0]

Rows 1 and 6: [0,0,0,5,3,8,8,3,5,0,0,0]

Rows 2 and 5: [0,0,0,3,2,8,8,2,3,0,0,0]

Rows 3 and 4: [0,0,5,8,8,6,6,8,8,5,0,0]

There's symmetry in rows 0-7.

Similarly, columns have symmetry.

Given that, perhaps the task is to extract the central 4x4 grid that represents the core pattern.

Alternatively, maybe it's to find the section where the most complex pattern occurs.

But based on the training examples, it seems straightforward: extract the minimal bounding box containing all non-zero elements.

Given that, for the test input, it would be rows 0 to 7, columns 2 to 9.

But that's 8x8, which doesn't match the 4x4 output of the training examples.

Perhaps the task is to resize the non-zero section to 4x4, regardless of its original size.

But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the task is to find a 4x4 section that contains the most non-zero elements or the most information.

But again, unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the output is always the central 4x4 section of the input grid.

Given that the input is always 12x12, the central 4x4 would be rows 4 to 7, columns 4 to 7.

For the test input, that would be:

Row 4: columns 4 to 7: [8,8,6,6]

Row 5: columns 4 to 7: [8,8,6,6]

Row 6: columns 4 to 7: [8,8,3,3]

Row 7: columns 4 to 7: [0,0,0,0]

Wait, but row 7 has all zeros in columns 4 to 7.

But in the test input, row 7 is [0,0,1,0,0,5,5,0,0,1,0,0], so columns 4 to 7 are [0,5,5,0].

Wait, indices start at 0, so columns 4 to 7 are indices 4,5,6,7.

In row 7: [0,0,1,0,0,5,5,0,0,1,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [0,5,5,0]

Similarly, row 4: [0,0,5,8,8,6,6,8,8,5,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [8,8,6,6]

Row 5: [0,0,0,3,2,8,8,2,3,0,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [2,8,8,2]

Row 6: [0,0,0,5,3,8,8,3,5,0,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [3,8,8,3]

So, the central 4x4 would be:

[[8,8,6,6],

 [2,8,8,2],

 [3,8,8,3],

 [0,5,5,0]]

But in the training examples, the output was always 4x4, but in this case, it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the task is to find the minimal bounding box that contains all non-zero elements and then resize it to 4x4.

But resizing doesn't make sense without specifying how to resize.

Alternatively, maybe it's to find the 4x4 section that has the highest concentration of non-zero elements.

But that seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps it's to find the 4x4 section that matches the pattern seen in the training examples.

Looking back at the training examples, the output seems to capture the core pattern of the input.

In the test input, the central 4x4 seems to be:

Row 2 to 5, columns 4 to 7:

Row 2: [0,0,0,3,2,8,8,2,3,0,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [2,8,8,2]

Row 3: [0,0,5,8,8,6,6,8,8,5,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [8,8,6,6]

Row 4: [0,0,5,8,8,6,6,8,8,5,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [8,8,6,6]

Row 5: [0,0,0,3,2,8,8,2,3,0,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [2,8,8,2]

So, output:

[[2,8,8,2],

 [8,8,6,6],

 [8,8,6,6],

 [2,8,8,2]]

This seems consistent with the training examples.

Alternatively, perhaps it's to find the section that is symmetric or has certain properties.

But for now, I'll go with extracting the central 4x4 section as the output.

## Final Solution
To solve this puzzle, we need to identify a pattern in the given input grids and produce the corresponding output grids as shown in the training examples. 

### Approach
1. **Identify the Pattern**: 
   - From the training examples, observe that the output is a 4x4 grid extracted from the center of the non-zero elements in the input grid.
   
2. **Extract the Central Section**:
   - For the test input, determine the central 4x4 section that contains the core pattern.

3. **Formulate the Output**:
   - Structure the extracted section into a 4x4 grid as per the observed pattern.

### Solution Code
```json
[[2,8,8,2],
 [8,8,6,6],
 [8,8,6,6],
 [2,8,8,2]]
```

### Explanation
- **Step 1**: Identify the central part of the input grid containing the non-zero elements.
- **Step 2**: Extract the 4x4 grid from the center of this section.
- **Step 3**: Format this extracted grid as the final output, ensuring it matches the structure seen in the training examples.

This approach ensures consistency with the patterns observed in the training data and correctly applies it to the test input.

Let's look at the training examples first to understand the pattern.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput:\n\n- A 12x12 grid of numbers.\n\n- The grid has some non-zero numbers arranged in a certain pattern.\n\nOutput:\n\n- A 4x4 grid.\n\n- It seems like the output is a cropped version of the input grid, focusing on a specific section.\n\nLooking at the input grid in Example 0, I notice that the non-zero numbers are clustered in the center of the grid, while the outer rows and columns are mostly zeros.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1:\n\nInput:\n\n- Again, a 12x12 grid with non-zero numbers clustered in the center.\n\nOutput:\n\n- A 4x4 grid that appears to be a cropped version of the central part of the input grid.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput:\n\n- A 12x12 grid with a similar pattern, non-zero numbers in the center.\n\nOutput:\n\n- A 4x4 grid that seems to capture the core section of the input grid.\n\nFrom these examples, it seems like the task is to identify the smallest bounding box that encompasses all the non-zero elements in the input grid and output that subsection.\n\nLet me verify this hypothesis with the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- The non-zero elements are between rows 2 to 5 and columns 2 to 5.\n\n- So, output is a 4x4 grid from row 2 to 5 and column 2 to 5.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1:\n\n- Non-zero elements are between rows 2 to 5 and columns 5 to 8.\n\n- Output is a 4x4 grid from row 2 to 5 and column 5 to 8.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\n- Non-zero elements are between rows 4 to 7 and columns 5 to 8.\n\n- Output is a 4x4 grid from row 4 to 7 and column 5 to 8.\n\nSo, the pattern is to find the minimal bounding box that includes all non-zero elements and extract that as the output.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 8, 8, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 8, 8, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 5, 8, 8, 6, 6, 8, 8, 5, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 3, 2, 8, 8, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 5, 3, 8, 8, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFirst, identify the rows and columns that contain non-zero elements.\n\nLooking at rows:\n\n- Row 0: has non-zero elements (1,5,5,1)\n\n- Row 1: has non-zero elements (5,3,8,8,3,5)\n\n- Row 2: has non-zero elements (3,2,8,8,2,3)\n\n- Row 3: has non-zero elements (5,8,8,6,6,8,8,5)\n\n- Row 4: has non-zero elements (5,8,8,6,6,8,8,5)\n\n- Row 5: has non-zero elements (3,2,8,8,2,3)\n\n- Row 6: has non-zero elements (5,3,8,8,3,5)\n\n- Row 7: has non-zero elements (1,5,5,1)\n\nRows 8-11 are all zeros, so the non-zero rows are from 0 to 7.\n\nNow, looking at columns:\n\n- Column 2: has non-zero elements in rows 0-7\n\n- Column 3: has non-zero elements in rows 1-7\n\n- Column 4: has non-zero elements in rows 1-7\n\n- Column 5: has non-zero elements in rows 0-7\n\n- Column 6: has non-zero elements in rows 0-7\n\n- Column 7: has non-zero elements in rows 1-7\n\n- Column 8: has non-zero elements in rows 0-7\n\n- Column 9: has non-zero elements in rows 0-7\n\nColumns 0,1,10,11 are all zeros.\n\nSo, the minimal bounding box is from row 0 to 7 and column 2 to 9.\n\nHowever, in the training examples, the output was always 4x4. But in this test input, the bounding box is 8x8.\n\nWait, but looking back at the training examples:\n\n- Example 0: input is 12x12, output is 4x4\n\n- Example 1: input is 12x12, output is 4x4\n\n- Example 2: input is 12x12, output is 4x4\n\nBut in this test input, if I follow the same logic, the output should be 8x8.\n\nBut perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nLet me consider that in all training examples, the output is 4x4, maybe the task is always to output a 4x4 grid from the center of the non-zero elements.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- Non-zero section is from row 2 to 5, column 2 to 5: that's 4 rows and 4 columns.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n- Non-zero section is from row 2 to 5, column 5 to 8: 4x4\n\nIn Example 2:\n\n- Non-zero section is from row 4 to 7, column 5 to 8: 4x4\n\nSo perhaps the task is always to find a 4x4 section.\n\nBut in the test input, the non-zero section is 8x8, which is larger than 4x4.\n\nMaybe I need to find the center 4x4 section in the non-zero area.\n\nIn the test input, the non-zero section is from row 0 to 7, column 2 to 9: 8x8 grid.\n\nThe center 4x4 would be from row 2 to 5, column 4 to 7.\n\nLet's extract that:\n\nRow 2: columns 4 to 7: [2,8,8,2]\n\nRow 3: columns 4 to 7: [8,8,6,6]\n\nRow 4: columns 4 to 7: [8,8,6,6]\n\nRow 5: columns 4 to 7: [2,8,8,2]\n\nSo the output should be:\n\n[[2,8,8,2],\n\n [8,8,6,6],\n\n [8,8,6,6],\n\n [2,8,8,2]]\n\nBut wait, in the training examples, the output was always 4x4, but in this case, if I extract 4x4 from the center, it matches the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different pattern altogether.\n\nLooking back at the training examples:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput is symmetric, and output is the central 4x4.\n\nSimilarly in Example 1 and Example 2.\n\nIn the test input, it also seems symmetric, so extracting the central 4x4 should be appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's always a 4x4 grid from the center of the non-zero elements.\n\nGiven that, for the test input, rows 0 to 7 and columns 2 to 9 have non-zero elements, so center rows would be rows 2 to 5 and center columns would be 4 to 7.\n\nSo, output should be:\n\n[[2,8,8,2],\n\n [8,8,6,6],\n\n [8,8,6,6],\n\n [2,8,8,2]]\n\nBut let's see if there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the training examples again:\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput is a 12x12 grid with a 4x4 non-zero center.\n\nOutput is that 4x4 grid.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput is a 12x12 grid with a 4x4 non-zero center in a different position.\n\nOutput is that 4x4 grid.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nSimilarly, a 4x4 non-zero center in a different position.\n\nOutput is that 4x4 grid.\n\nIn the test input, the non-zero section is larger, 8x8.\n\nPerhaps the task is to find the innermost 4x4 grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's to find the smallest square that contains all the non-zero elements.\n\nBut in the training examples, the non-zero sections were already 4x4.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the task is simply to find and extract a 4x4 section from the input grid based on certain rules.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a downsampled version of the input grid, keeping only every nth row and column.\n\nBut in the training examples, the input is 12x12 and output is 4x4, which would correspond to keeping every third row and column.\n\nBut in the test input, if I take every third row and column, starting from row 0 and column 0, I get:\n\nRow 0, columns 0,3,6,9:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3, columns 0,3,6,9:\n\n[0,8,6,3]\n\nRow 6, columns 0,3,6,9:\n\n[0,8,6,3]\n\nRow 9, columns 0,3,6,9:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nWhich doesn't match any of the patterns in the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, starting from row 1, column 1:\n\nRow 1, columns 1,4,7,10:\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\nRow 4, columns 1,4,7,10:\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\nRow 7, columns 1,4,7,10:\n\n[0,3,3,0]\n\nRow 10, columns 1,4,7,10:\n\n[0,0,0,0]\n\nStill not matching.\n\nPerhaps downsampling isn't the right approach.\n\nLet me consider another angle.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, the output seems to be a cropped and possibly transformed version of the input.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nInput has a 4x4 non-zero section from row 2 to 5, column 2 to 5.\n\nOutput is exactly that section.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nInput has a 4x4 non-zero section from row 2 to 5, column 5 to 8.\n\nOutput is that section.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput has a 4x4 non-zero section from row 4 to 7, column 5 to 8.\n\nOutput is that section.\n\nIn the test input, the non-zero section is larger, from row 0 to 7, column 2 to 9.\n\nPerhaps the task is to find the minimal bounding box that contains all non-zero elements and then crop that section.\n\nBut in the training examples, it's always 4x4, but in the test input, it would be 8x8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a specific pattern in the arrangement of numbers.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRows 0 and 7 are similar: [0,0,1,0,0,5,5,0,0,1,0,0]\n\nRows 1 and 6: [0,0,0,5,3,8,8,3,5,0,0,0]\n\nRows 2 and 5: [0,0,0,3,2,8,8,2,3,0,0,0]\n\nRows 3 and 4: [0,0,5,8,8,6,6,8,8,5,0,0]\n\nThere's symmetry in rows 0-7.\n\nSimilarly, columns have symmetry.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the task is to extract the central 4x4 grid that represents the core pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's to find the section where the most complex pattern occurs.\n\nBut based on the training examples, it seems straightforward: extract the minimal bounding box containing all non-zero elements.\n\nGiven that, for the test input, it would be rows 0 to 7, columns 2 to 9.\n\nBut that's 8x8, which doesn't match the 4x4 output of the training examples.\n\nPerhaps the task is to resize the non-zero section to 4x4, regardless of its original size.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the task is to find a 4x4 section that contains the most non-zero elements or the most information.\n\nBut again, unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is always the central 4x4 section of the input grid.\n\nGiven that the input is always 12x12, the central 4x4 would be rows 4 to 7, columns 4 to 7.\n\nFor the test input, that would be:\n\nRow 4: columns 4 to 7: [8,8,6,6]\n\nRow 5: columns 4 to 7: [8,8,6,6]\n\nRow 6: columns 4 to 7: [8,8,3,3]\n\nRow 7: columns 4 to 7: [0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but row 7 has all zeros in columns 4 to 7.\n\nBut in the test input, row 7 is [0,0,1,0,0,5,5,0,0,1,0,0], so columns 4 to 7 are [0,5,5,0].\n\nWait, indices start at 0, so columns 4 to 7 are indices 4,5,6,7.\n\nIn row 7: [0,0,1,0,0,5,5,0,0,1,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [0,5,5,0]\n\nSimilarly, row 4: [0,0,5,8,8,6,6,8,8,5,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [8,8,6,6]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,3,2,8,8,2,3,0,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [2,8,8,2]\n\nRow 6: [0,0,0,5,3,8,8,3,5,0,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [3,8,8,3]\n\nSo, the central 4x4 would be:\n\n[[8,8,6,6],\n\n [2,8,8,2],\n\n [3,8,8,3],\n\n [0,5,5,0]]\n\nBut in the training examples, the output was always 4x4, but in this case, it's different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the task is to find the minimal bounding box that contains all non-zero elements and then resize it to 4x4.\n\nBut resizing doesn't make sense without specifying how to resize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's to find the 4x4 section that has the highest concentration of non-zero elements.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's to find the 4x4 section that matches the pattern seen in the training examples.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, the output seems to capture the core pattern of the input.\n\nIn the test input, the central 4x4 seems to be:\n\nRow 2 to 5, columns 4 to 7:\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,3,2,8,8,2,3,0,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [2,8,8,2]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,5,8,8,6,6,8,8,5,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [8,8,6,6]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,5,8,8,6,6,8,8,5,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [8,8,6,6]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,3,2,8,8,2,3,0,0,0] → columns 4 to 7: [2,8,8,2]\n\nSo, output:\n\n[[2,8,8,2],\n\n [8,8,6,6],\n\n [8,8,6,6],\n\n [2,8,8,2]]\n\nThis seems consistent with the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's to find the section that is symmetric or has certain properties.\n\nBut for now, I'll go with extracting the central 4x4 section as the output.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to identify a pattern in the given input grids and produce the corresponding output grids as shown in the training examples. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Pattern**: \n   - From the training examples, observe that the output is a 4x4 grid extracted from the center of the non-zero elements in the input grid.\n   \n2. **Extract the Central Section**:\n   - For the test input, determine the central 4x4 section that contains the core pattern.\n\n3. **Formulate the Output**:\n   - Structure the extracted section into a 4x4 grid as per the observed pattern.\n\n### Solution Code\n```json\n[[2,8,8,2],\n [8,8,6,6],\n [8,8,6,6],\n [2,8,8,2]]\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Step 1**: Identify the central part of the input grid containing the non-zero elements.\n- **Step 2**: Extract the 4x4 grid from the center of this section.\n- **Step 3**: Format this extracted grid as the final output, ensuring it matches the structure seen in the training examples.\n\nThis approach ensures consistency with the patterns observed in the training data and correctly applies it to the test input.", 'final_json': None, 'retries': 0, 'task_id':
