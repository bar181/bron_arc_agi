Raw model response:
I've got this puzzle to solve. Let's see what's going on here. There are training examples with inputs and outputs, and I need to find a pattern or transformation that maps the input to the output. Then, apply that same pattern to the test input to get the final output.

First, I need to understand the structure of the inputs and outputs. Looking at example 0:

INPUT:

- A list of lists, each containing 20 elements, which are either 0, 1, or 2.

- The pattern seems to be mostly 1s and 0s, with some 2s appearing in specific positions.

OUTPUT:

- Similar structure, but with some changes in the values, particularly where 2s are present.

Comparing input and output in example 0:

- In the input, there are some rows with 2s, and in the output, those 2s seem to have propagated or influenced neighboring cells.

- Specifically, in rows where there are 2s, not only those cells have 2s in the output, but also some adjacent rows have their corresponding cells turned into 2s.

Let me look at example 1 to see if a similar pattern holds.

INPUT:

- Again, a list of lists with 0, 1, or 3s in them.

- The structure is similar, with some rows having 3s in specific positions.

OUTPUT:

- The output shows that the 3s have influenced neighboring rows, turning more cells into 3s.

From these observations, it seems like the transformation involves propagating the value (2 or 3) in certain cells to their neighboring cells in specific rows.

Let me try to formalize this pattern.

Hypothesis:

- Identify the rows and columns where the input has a value greater than 1 (i.e., 2 or 3).

- In the output, not only those cells have the same value, but also the cells directly above and below them in the same column are set to that value.

- Essentially, for each cell with a value >1, set the cell itself, the cell directly above, and the cell directly below to that value in the output.

Let me test this hypothesis with example 0.

In example 0, the input has 2s in some positions, and in the output, those positions and their immediate neighbors above and below have been set to 2.

Similarly, in example 1, 3s are propagated to their immediate vertical neighbors.

This seems consistent.

Now, let's apply this transformation to the test input.

TEST INPUT:

- Looking at the test input, it has 8s in some positions.

- According to the hypothesis, we should set the cells with 8s and their immediate vertical neighbors to 8.

Let me proceed to apply this transformation.

First, I need to iterate through each cell in the input grid.

- For each cell that has a value >1 (in this case, 8), set that cell and the cells directly above and below it (if they exist) to that value (8).

I need to be careful with the boundaries; i.e., the first and last rows don't have cells above or below, respectively.

Let's go row by row.

Looking at the test input:

Row 0:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

No values >1.

Row 1:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

All zeros.

Row 2:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

No values >1.

Row 3:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

No values >1.

Row 4:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

All zeros.

Row 5:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

Here, columns 15, 16 have 8s.

According to the hypothesis:

- Set row 4, columns 15,16 to 8 (if row 4 exists).

- Set row 5, columns 15,16 to 8.

- Set row 6, columns 15,16 to 8 (if row 6 exists).

Row 6:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

Again, columns 15,16 have 8s.

So, for row 5 and row 7 (if it exists), columns 15,16 should be set to 8.

Row 7:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

All zeros.

Row 8:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

No values >1.

Row 9:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

No values >1.

Row 10:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

All zeros.

Row 11:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

No values >1.

Row 12:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

No values >1.

Row 13:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

All zeros.

Row 14:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

No values >1.

Row 15:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

No values >1.

Row 16:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

All zeros.

Row 17:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

No values >1.

Row 18:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

No values >1.

Row 19:

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

All zeros.

So, only rows 5 and 6 have values >1, specifically in columns 15 and 16.

According to the hypothesis:

- For row 5, columns 15 and 16: set row 4, row 5, and row 6, columns 15 and 16 to 8.

- Similarly, for row 6, columns 15 and 16: set row 5, row 6, and row 7, columns 15 and 16 to 8.

Note that row 4 and row 7 exist, so all these cells should be set to 8.

Wait a minute, row 5 is common in both, so rows 4,5,6,7 will have columns 15 and 16 set to 8.

Now, let's construct the output grid accordingly.

Start with the original input grid and modify the specified cells to 8.

Let's list out the changes:

- Row 4, columns 15 and 16: set to 8

- Row 5, columns 15 and 16: set to 8

- Row 6, columns 15 and 16: set to 8

- Row 7, columns 15 and 16: set to 8

Now, apply these changes to the original input.

Original input:

Row 0: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 2: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 3: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 5: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,0,1,1]

Row 6: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,0,1,1]

Row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 8: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 9: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 11: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 12: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 14: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 15: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 17: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 18: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Now, apply the changes:

- Row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]

- Row 5: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]

- Row 6: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]

- Row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]

Wait, but in row 5 and row 6, columns 15 and 16 were already 8s in the input, except for row 5 column 15 was 0, but in row 5, column 15 was originally 0, but according to the hypothesis, it should be set to 8.

Wait, hold on.

Looking back, in row 5, columns 15 and 16 were 0, but in row 6, they are 8.

Wait, no.

Wait, in row 5: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,0,1,1]

So, columns 15 and 16 are 8, and column 14 is 0.

Similarly, row 6: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,0,1,1]

Columns 15 and 16 are 8, column 14 is 0.

According to the hypothesis, for each cell with value >1, set that cell, the cell above, and the cell below to that value.

So, for row 5, columns 15 and 16:

- Set row 4, columns 15 and 16 to 8

- Set row 5, columns 15 and 16 to 8

- Set row 6, columns 15 and 16 to 8

Similarly, for row 6, columns 15 and 16:

- Set row 5, columns 15 and 16 to 8 (already set)

- Set row 6, columns 15 and 16 to 8 (already set)

- Set row 7, columns 15 and 16 to 8

So, overall:

- Row 4: set columns 15 and 16 to 8

- Row 5: set columns 15 and 16 to 8

- Row 6: set columns 15 and 16 to 8

- Row 7: set columns 15 and 16 to 8

Now, construct the output grid accordingly.

Let's list out the output rows:

Row 0: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 2: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 3: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]

Row 5: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]

Row 6: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]

Row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]

Row 8: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 9: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 11: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 12: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 14: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 15: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 17: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 18: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]

Row 19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Wait, but in row 5 and row 6, columns 15 and 16 were already 8 in the input, but according to the transformation, we set them again to 8, which doesn't change anything.

But in rows 4 and 7, columns 15 and 16 were 0, so they should be set to 8.

So, the output should have:

- Row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]

- Row 5: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]

- Row 6: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]

- Row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]

All other rows remain unchanged.

Let me confirm this with the training examples.

In example 0:

- Input has 2s in some positions, and output has 2s in those positions and their immediate vertical neighbors.

Similarly in example 1:

- Input has 3s in some positions, and output has 3s in those positions and their immediate vertical neighbors.

So, this seems consistent.

Therefore, applying the same logic to the test input, the output should have 8s in the specified positions.

Now, I need to format this output as a JSON array, matching the structure of the training outputs.

Each row is a list of 20 elements, and there are 20 rows in total.

So, the output should be a list of 20 lists, each containing 20 elements.

Let me construct this step by step.

Starting with the original test input and modifying the specified cells.

Here's the original test input again for reference:

[

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,0,1,1],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,0,1,1],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

]

Now, modify rows 4,5,6,7 to set columns 15 and 16 to 8.

Row indices are 0-based:

- Row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]

- Row 5: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]

- Row 6: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]

- Row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]

All other rows remain the same.

So, the output should be:

[

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

]

I think this should be the correct output based on the observed pattern.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or transformation that maps the given input to the output based on the provided training examples and then apply that pattern to the test input to generate the final output.

### Approach
1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Examine the training examples to understand how the input is transformed into the output.
   - Identify that the transformation involves propagating specific values (greater than 1) to their immediate vertical neighbors in the grid.

2. **Formulate the Transformation Rule:**
   - For each cell in the input grid that has a value greater than 1, set the corresponding cell, the cell directly above, and the cell directly below in the output grid to that value.
   - Handle edge cases where the cell is in the first or last row, ensuring not to access invalid indices.

3. **Apply the Transformation to the Test Input:**
   - Iterate through each cell in the test input grid.
   - Apply the identified transformation rule to generate the output grid.

### Solution Code
```python
def transform_grid(input_grid):

Let's see what's going on here. There are training examples with inputs and outputs, and I need to find a pattern or transformation that maps the input to the output. Then, apply that same pattern to the test input to get the final output.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the inputs and outputs. Looking at example 0:\n\nINPUT:\n\n- A list of lists, each containing 20 elements, which are either 0, 1, or 2.\n\n- The pattern seems to be mostly 1s and 0s, with some 2s appearing in specific positions.\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n- Similar structure, but with some changes in the values, particularly where 2s are present.\n\nComparing input and output in example 0:\n\n- In the input, there are some rows with 2s, and in the output, those 2s seem to have propagated or influenced neighboring cells.\n\n- Specifically, in rows where there are 2s, not only those cells have 2s in the output, but also some adjacent rows have their corresponding cells turned into 2s.\n\nLet me look at example 1 to see if a similar pattern holds.\n\nINPUT:\n\n- Again, a list of lists with 0, 1, or 3s in them.\n\n- The structure is similar, with some rows having 3s in specific positions.\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n- The output shows that the 3s have influenced neighboring rows, turning more cells into 3s.\n\nFrom these observations, it seems like the transformation involves propagating the value (2 or 3) in certain cells to their neighboring cells in specific rows.\n\nLet me try to formalize this pattern.\n\nHypothesis:\n\n- Identify the rows and columns where the input has a value greater than 1 (i.e., 2 or 3).\n\n- In the output, not only those cells have the same value, but also the cells directly above and below them in the same column are set to that value.\n\n- Essentially, for each cell with a value >1, set the cell itself, the cell directly above, and the cell directly below to that value in the output.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with example 0.\n\nIn example 0, the input has 2s in some positions, and in the output, those positions and their immediate neighbors above and below have been set to 2.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1, 3s are propagated to their immediate vertical neighbors.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nNow, let's apply this transformation to the test input.\n\nTEST INPUT:\n\n- Looking at the test input, it has 8s in some positions.\n\n- According to the hypothesis, we should set the cells with 8s and their immediate vertical neighbors to 8.\n\nLet me proceed to apply this transformation.\n\nFirst, I need to iterate through each cell in the input grid.\n\n- For each cell that has a value >1 (in this case, 8), set that cell and the cells directly above and below it (if they exist) to that value (8).\n\nI need to be careful with the boundaries; i.e., the first and last rows don't have cells above or below, respectively.\n\nLet's go row by row.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow 0:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nNo values >1.\n\nRow 1:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAll zeros.\n\nRow 2:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nNo values >1.\n\nRow 3:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nNo values >1.\n\nRow 4:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAll zeros.\n\nRow 5:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]\n\nHere, columns 15, 16 have 8s.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis:\n\n- Set row 4, columns 15,16 to 8 (if row 4 exists).\n\n- Set row 5, columns 15,16 to 8.\n\n- Set row 6, columns 15,16 to 8 (if row 6 exists).\n\nRow 6:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]\n\nAgain, columns 15,16 have 8s.\n\nSo, for row 5 and row 7 (if it exists), columns 15,16 should be set to 8.\n\nRow 7:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAll zeros.\n\nRow 8:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nNo values >1.\n\nRow 9:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nNo values >1.\n\nRow 10:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAll zeros.\n\nRow 11:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nNo values >1.\n\nRow 12:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nNo values >1.\n\nRow 13:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAll zeros.\n\nRow 14:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nNo values >1.\n\nRow 15:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nNo values >1.\n\nRow 16:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAll zeros.\n\nRow 17:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nNo values >1.\n\nRow 18:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n\nNo values >1.\n\nRow 19:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nAll zeros.\n\nSo, only rows 5 and 6 have values >1, specifically in columns 15 and 16.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis:\n\n- For row 5, columns 15 and 16: set row 4, row 5, and row 6, columns 15 and 16 to 8.\n\n- Similarly, for row 6, columns 15 and 16: set row 5, row 6, and row 7, columns 15 and 16 to 8.\n\nNote that row 4 and row 7 exist, so all these cells should be set to 8.\n\nWait a minute, row 5 is common in both, so rows 4,5,6,7 will have columns 15 and 16 set to 8.\n\nNow, let's construct the output grid accordingly.\n\nStart with the original input grid and modify the specified cells to 8.\n\nLet's list out the changes:\n\n- Row 4, columns 15 and 16: set to 8\n\n- Row 5, columns 15 and 16: set to 8\n\n- Row 6, columns 15 and 16: set to 8\n\n- Row 7, columns 15 and 16: set to 8\n\nNow, apply these changes to the original input.\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 3: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,0,1,1]\n\nRow 6: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,0,1,1]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 9: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 11: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 12: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 14: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 15: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 17: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 18: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nNow, apply the changes:\n\n- Row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n- Row 5: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]\n\n- Row 6: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]\n\n- Row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but in row 5 and row 6, columns 15 and 16 were already 8s in the input, except for row 5 column 15 was 0, but in row 5, column 15 was originally 0, but according to the hypothesis, it should be set to 8.\n\nWait, hold on.\n\nLooking back, in row 5, columns 15 and 16 were 0, but in row 6, they are 8.\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, in row 5: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,0,1,1]\n\nSo, columns 15 and 16 are 8, and column 14 is 0.\n\nSimilarly, row 6: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,0,1,1]\n\nColumns 15 and 16 are 8, column 14 is 0.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, for each cell with value >1, set that cell, the cell above, and the cell below to that value.\n\nSo, for row 5, columns 15 and 16:\n\n- Set row 4, columns 15 and 16 to 8\n\n- Set row 5, columns 15 and 16 to 8\n\n- Set row 6, columns 15 and 16 to 8\n\nSimilarly, for row 6, columns 15 and 16:\n\n- Set row 5, columns 15 and 16 to 8 (already set)\n\n- Set row 6, columns 15 and 16 to 8 (already set)\n\n- Set row 7, columns 15 and 16 to 8\n\nSo, overall:\n\n- Row 4: set columns 15 and 16 to 8\n\n- Row 5: set columns 15 and 16 to 8\n\n- Row 6: set columns 15 and 16 to 8\n\n- Row 7: set columns 15 and 16 to 8\n\nNow, construct the output grid accordingly.\n\nLet's list out the output rows:\n\nRow 0: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 3: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]\n\nRow 6: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 9: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 11: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 12: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 14: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 15: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 17: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 18: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1]\n\nRow 19: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, but in row 5 and row 6, columns 15 and 16 were already 8 in the input, but according to the transformation, we set them again to 8, which doesn't change anything.\n\nBut in rows 4 and 7, columns 15 and 16 were 0, so they should be set to 8.\n\nSo, the output should have:\n\n- Row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n- Row 5: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]\n\n- Row 6: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]\n\n- Row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nAll other rows remain unchanged.\n\nLet me confirm this with the training examples.\n\nIn example 0:\n\n- Input has 2s in some positions, and output has 2s in those positions and their immediate vertical neighbors.\n\nSimilarly in example 1:\n\n- Input has 3s in some positions, and output has 3s in those positions and their immediate vertical neighbors.\n\nSo, this seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, applying the same logic to the test input, the output should have 8s in the specified positions.\n\nNow, I need to format this output as a JSON array, matching the structure of the training outputs.\n\nEach row is a list of 20 elements, and there are 20 rows in total.\n\nSo, the output should be a list of 20 lists, each containing 20 elements.\n\nLet me construct this step by step.\n\nStarting with the original test input and modifying the specified cells.\n\nHere's the original test input again for reference:\n\n[\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,0,1,1],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,8,8,0,1,1],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n]\n\nNow, modify rows 4,5,6,7 to set columns 15 and 16 to 8.\n\nRow indices are 0-based:\n\n- Row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\n- Row 5: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]\n\n- Row 6: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0]\n\n- Row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0]\n\nAll other rows remain the same.\n\nSo, the output should be:\n\n[\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,8,8,0,1,1,0],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,0,0,0,0],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1],\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n]\n\nI think this should be the correct output based on the observed pattern.\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify a pattern or transformation that maps the given input to the output based on the provided training examples and then apply that pattern to the test input to generate the final output.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - Examine the training examples to understand how the input is transformed into the output.\n   - Identify that the transformation involves propagating specific values (greater than 1) to their immediate vertical neighbors in the grid.\n\n2. **Formulate the Transformation Rule:**\n   - For each cell in the input grid that has a value greater than 1, set the corresponding cell, the cell directly above, and the cell directly below in the output grid to that value.\n   - Handle edge cases where the cell is in the first or last row, ensuring not to access invalid indices.\n\n3. **Apply the Transformation to the
