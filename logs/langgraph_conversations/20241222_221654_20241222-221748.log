Raw model response:
I carefully analyzed the training examples to identify the pattern or transformation that maps the input to the output. In each training example, the input is a 14x14 grid of numbers, mostly consisting of 0s, 8s, and 1s, while the output is similar but replaces the 8s with different numbers (2, 3, 7, etc.), and sets many elements to 0.

Looking at Example 0:

- Input has 8s in specific patterns, and 1s in a small cluster.

- Output replaces 8s with 2s, and sets the area with 1s to 0s.

Similarly, in Example 1:

- Input has 8s in a different pattern, and 1s in another small cluster.

- Output replaces 8s with 3s, and sets the area with 1s to 0s.

This suggests that the transformation involves replacing all 8s with a new number (which seems to be increasing in examples: 2, 3, 7), and zeroing out areas where 1s are present.

However, in all output examples, the areas that had 1s in the input are set to 0s in the output, and the 8s are replaced with a different number, but the number chosen (2, 3, 7) doesn't seem to follow a specific rule based on the input.

Wait, looking closer:

- In Example 0, 8s are replaced with 2s.

- In Example 1, 8s are replaced with 3s.

- In Example 2, 8s are replaced with 2s.

- In Example 3, 8s are replaced with 7s.

- In Example 4, 8s are replaced with 3s.

There doesn't seem to be a consistent rule for choosing the replacement number for 8s based on the input alone. It might be arbitrary or based on some other factor not immediately obvious.

Alternatively, perhaps the replacement number is based on the position or the pattern of 8s.

Looking at the positions of 8s in each example:

- Example 0: 8s form multiple patterns.

- Example 1: 8s form a dense grid in the top-left.

- Example 2: 8s form a vertical line and some additional patterns.

- Example 3: 8s form a more complex pattern.

- Example 4: 8s form a smaller pattern.

It's unclear how the replacement number is determined based on the pattern alone.

Alternatively, perhaps the replacement number is determined by the number of connected components of 8s.

Looking at the inputs:

- Example 0: Multiple separate clusters of 8s.

- Example 1: Seems like one large cluster of 8s.

- Example 2: Appears to be one vertical cluster with extensions.

- Example 3: Multiple clusters.

- Example 4: One cluster of 8s.

But the replacement numbers don't seem to correlate directly with the number of clusters.

Alternatively, perhaps the replacement number is based on the size of the clusters.

- Example 0: Several small clusters.

- Example 1: One large cluster.

- Example 2: One long vertical cluster with branches.

- Example 3: Multiple clusters of varying sizes.

Again, no clear correlation between cluster size and the replacement number.

Alternatively, maybe the replacement number is simply the next integer in sequence for each example, but that doesn't hold as Example 2 replaces with 2, then Example 3 with 7, which isn't sequential.

Alternatively, perhaps the replacement number is based on the position of the 1s.

Looking at the positions of 1s:

- Example 0: 1s in rows 10-12, columns 1-3.

- Example 1: 1s in rows 11-13, columns 4-6.

- Example 2: 1s in row 10, column 9, and rows 11-12, columns 8-10.

- Example 3: 1s in rows 11-13, columns 4-6.

- Example 4: 1s in rows 9-11, columns 2-4 and 5.

It's unclear how these positions relate to the replacement number for 8s.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing all 8s with a specific number that is not present in the 1s area.

But in the output, the areas with 1s are set to 0s, and 8s are replaced with a number that wasn't present in the input.

But since the input only has 0s, 8s, and 1s, any number besides those could be used.

However, in the training outputs, they used 2, 3, 7, etc., which are not in the input.

But in the test input, there might be different numbers, so I need to choose a number that doesn't appear in the test input.

Looking at the test input:

- It has 0s, 8s, and 1s.

- So, I should choose a number not present in the input, like 4, to replace the 8s.

But in the training examples, they used different numbers (2,3,7), so perhaps I need to find a pattern in how they choose these numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the replacement number is based on the sum or some property of the positions of the 8s.

This seems too convoluted.

Another thought: perhaps the replacement number is based on the number of 8s in the input.

- Example 0: Many 8s.

- Example 1: Even more 8s.

- Example 2: A lot of 8s.

- Example 3: Many 8s.

- Example 4: Fewer 8s.

But again, no clear correlation.

Alternatively, maybe the replacement number is based on the position of the first 8 in the grid.

But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all 8s with a specific number, and set all 1s and their neighboring cells to 0.

Looking back at the training outputs:

- Areas with 1s are set to 0s, and in some cases, neighboring cells are also set to 0.

But in Example 0, the area with 1s is set to 0s, and the 8s are replaced with 2s elsewhere.

Similarly, in Example 1, the area with 1s is set to 0s, and 8s are replaced with 3s.

So, perhaps the general rule is:

1. Identify the cluster of 1s.

2. Set the cluster of 1s and possibly their neighbors to 0.

3. Replace all 8s not in the area affected by the 1s cluster with a new number.

But this still doesn't explain how to choose the new number.

Alternatively, perhaps the new number is arbitrary, and I can choose any number not present in the input for the replacement.

Given that, in the test input, which has 0s, 1s, and 8s, I can choose to replace 8s with, say, 4, and set the area with 1s to 0s.

Looking at the test input:

- The 1s are in rows 9-11, columns 6-8.

- So, set these to 0s.

- Replace all 8s with 4s.

But need to verify if this is consistent with training examples.

In Example 0:

- 1s in rows 10-12, columns 1-3.

- Output sets these to 0s and replaces 8s with 2s.

Similarly in other examples.

So, the general pattern seems to be:

- Identify the cluster of 1s.

- Set that cluster to 0s.

- Replace all 8s that are not adjacent or connected to the 1s cluster with a new number.

Wait, but in the outputs, all 8s are replaced, not just those not connected to 1s.

Wait, in Example 0, the 8s are replaced everywhere, except where 1s are.

But in the output, the area with 1s is set to 0s, and the 8s are replaced with 2s elsewhere.

Wait, but in the output, all 8s are replaced with 2s, and the area with 1s is set to 0s.

So, it's a two-step process:

1. Set all 1s and possibly their adjacent cells to 0s.

2. Replace all 8s with a new number.

But in the training outputs, after setting the 1s area to 0s, all remaining 8s are replaced with a new number.

Given that, in the test input, I should:

1. Set the area with 1s (rows 9-11, columns 6-8) to 0s.

2. Replace all remaining 8s with a new number not present in the input, say 4.

But need to ensure that the replacement number is consistent across the grid.

Looking back at the training examples, the replacement number is different in each example (2,3,7,etc.), so it seems arbitrary as long as it's not present in the input.

Therefore, for the test input, I can choose 4 as the replacement number for 8s.

So, the steps are:

1. Set all 1s and their adjacent cells to 0s.

2. Replace all 8s with 4s.

Wait, but in the training examples, only the 1s area is set to 0s, not necessarily their adjacent cells.

In Example 0, the 1s are in rows 10-12, columns 1-3, and only those cells are set to 0s in the output, the adjacent cells remain as 0s or 8s (replaced with 2s).

So, perhaps only the 1s are set to 0s, and the 8s are replaced elsewhere.

Therefore, in the test input:

- Set the 1s in rows 9-11, columns 6-8 to 0s.

- Replace all 8s with 4s.

But need to confirm if there are any 8s adjacent to the 1s that should not be replaced.

In Example 0, the 8s adjacent to the 1s area are replaced with 2s, as long as they are not in the 1s area.

So, in the test input, I should replace all 8s with 4s, except those in the 1s area, which are set to 0s.

Wait, but in the test input, there are no 8s in the same row and column as the 1s, so all 8s can be replaced with 4s.

Looking at the test input:

- 1s are in rows 9-11, columns 6-8.

- 8s are in rows 2-5, columns 6-13.

So, no overlap.

Therefore, set the 1s to 0s and replace all 8s with 4s.

Hence, the output should be:

- Rows 9-11, columns 6-8 set to 0s.

- All 8s replaced with 4s.

Therefore, the output grid would have:

- Original 0s remain 0s.

- Original 1s set to 0s.

- Original 8s set to 4s.

So, the final output is a grid where:

- All 1s are set to 0s.

- All 8s are set to 4s.

- All other cells remain 0s.

Thus, the JSON array for the output would reflect this transformation.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to transform the given input grid based on specific rules derived from the training examples. The goal is to replace all occurrences of the number 8 with a new number (chosen to be 4 in this case, as it's not present in the input) and set all occurrences of the number 1 to 0.

### Approach

1. **Identify Areas to Modify**:
   - Locate all cells containing the number 1 and set them to 0.
   - Replace all cells containing the number 8 with 4.

2. **Implement Transformation**:
   - Iterate through each cell in the grid.
   - If a cell contains 1, set it to 0.
   - If a cell contains 8, set it to 4.
   - Leave all other cells unchanged.

### Solution Code

```python
def transform_grid(input_grid):
    # Choose a new number for replacement, e.g., 4
    replacement_number = 4
    output_grid = []
    
    for row in input_grid:
        new_row = []
        for cell in row:
            if cell == 1:
                new_row.append(0)
            elif cell == 8:
                new_row.append(replacement_number)
            else:
                new_row.append(cell)
        output_grid.append(new_row)
    
    return output_grid

# Example usage:
input_grid = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

output_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)
for row in output_grid:
    print(row)
```

### Explanation

1. **Identify and Modify Cells**:
   - We iterate through each row and each cell in the grid.
   - If a cell contains 1, it is set to 0.
   - If a cell contains 8, it is set to 4.
   - All other cells remain unchanged.

2. **Construct Output Grid**:
   - We build a new grid (`output_grid`) with the transformed values.
   - This grid is then returned as the final output.

This approach ensures that the transformation rules observed in the training examples are applied consistently to the test input.

Input--\n\nYour response:', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})], 'next_step': 'generate', 'current_response': "I carefully analyzed the training examples to identify the pattern or transformation that maps the input to the output. In each training example, the input is a 14x14 grid of numbers, mostly consisting of 0s, 8s, and 1s, while the output is similar but replaces the 8s with different numbers (2, 3, 7, etc.), and sets many elements to 0.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\n- Input has 8s in specific patterns, and 1s in a small cluster.\n\n- Output replaces 8s with 2s, and sets the area with 1s to 0s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1:\n\n- Input has 8s in a different pattern, and 1s in another small cluster.\n\n- Output replaces 8s with 3s, and sets the area with 1s to 0s.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation involves replacing all 8s with a new number (which seems to be increasing in examples: 2, 3, 7), and zeroing out areas where 1s are present.\n\nHowever, in all output examples, the areas that had 1s in the input are set to 0s in the output, and the 8s are replaced with a different number, but the number chosen (2, 3, 7) doesn't seem to follow a specific rule based on the input.\n\nWait, looking closer:\n\n- In Example 0, 8s are replaced with 2s.\n\n- In Example 1, 8s are replaced with 3s.\n\n- In Example 2, 8s are replaced with 2s.\n\n- In Example 3, 8s are replaced with 7s.\n\n- In Example 4, 8s are replaced with 3s.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a consistent rule for choosing the replacement number for 8s based on the input alone. It might be arbitrary or based on some other factor not immediately obvious.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is based on the position or the pattern of 8s.\n\nLooking at the positions of 8s in each example:\n\n- Example 0: 8s form multiple patterns.\n\n- Example 1: 8s form a dense grid in the top-left.\n\n- Example 2: 8s form a vertical line and some additional patterns.\n\n- Example 3: 8s form a more complex pattern.\n\n- Example 4: 8s form a smaller pattern.\n\nIt's unclear how the replacement number is determined based on the pattern alone.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is determined by the number of connected components of 8s.\n\nLooking at the inputs:\n\n- Example 0: Multiple separate clusters of 8s.\n\n- Example 1: Seems like one large cluster of 8s.\n\n- Example 2: Appears to be one vertical cluster with extensions.\n\n- Example 3: Multiple clusters.\n\n- Example 4: One cluster of 8s.\n\nBut the replacement numbers don't seem to correlate directly with the number of clusters.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is based on the size of the clusters.\n\n- Example 0: Several small clusters.\n\n- Example 1: One large cluster.\n\n- Example 2: One long vertical cluster with branches.\n\n- Example 3: Multiple clusters of varying sizes.\n\nAgain, no clear correlation between cluster size and the replacement number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number is simply the next integer in sequence for each example, but that doesn't hold as Example 2 replaces with 2, then Example 3 with 7, which isn't sequential.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is based on the position of the 1s.\n\nLooking at the positions of 1s:\n\n- Example 0: 1s in rows 10-12, columns 1-3.\n\n- Example 1: 1s in rows 11-13, columns 4-6.\n\n- Example 2: 1s in row 10, column 9, and rows 11-12, columns 8-10.\n\n- Example 3: 1s in rows 11-13, columns 4-6.\n\n- Example 4: 1s in rows 9-11, columns 2-4 and 5.\n\nIt's unclear how these positions relate to the replacement number for 8s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing all 8s with a specific number that is not present in the 1s area.\n\nBut in the output, the areas with 1s are set to 0s, and 8s are replaced with a number that wasn't present in the input.\n\nBut since the input only has 0s, 8s, and 1s, any number besides those could be used.\n\nHowever, in the training outputs, they used 2, 3, 7, etc., which are not in the input.\n\nBut in the test input, there might be different numbers, so I need to choose a number that doesn't appear in the test input.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n- It has 0s, 8s, and 1s.\n\n- So, I should choose a number not present in the input, like 4, to replace the 8s.\n\nBut in the training examples, they used different numbers (2,3,7), so perhaps I need to find a pattern in how they choose these numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement number is based on the sum or some property of the positions of the 8s.\n\nThis seems too convoluted.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the replacement number is based on the number of 8s in the input.\n\n- Example 0: Many 8s.\n\n- Example 1: Even more 8s.\n\n- Example 2: A lot of 8s.\n\n- Example 3: Many 8s.\n\n- Example 4: Fewer 8s.\n\nBut again, no clear correlation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement number is based on the position of the first 8 in the grid.\n\nBut that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all 8s with a specific number, and set all 1s and their neighboring cells to 0.\n\nLooking back at the training outputs:\n\n- Areas with 1s are set to 0s, and in some cases, neighboring cells are also set to 0.\n\nBut in Example 0, the area with 1s is set to 0s, and the 8s are replaced with 2s elsewhere.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the area with 1s is set to 0s, and 8s are replaced with 3s.\n\nSo, perhaps the general rule is:\n\n1. Identify the cluster of 1s.\n\n2. Set the cluster of 1s and possibly their neighbors to 0.\n\n3. Replace all 8s not in the area affected by the 1s cluster with a new number.\n\nBut this still doesn't explain how to choose the new number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new number is arbitrary, and I can choose any number not present in the input for the replacement.\n\nGiven that, in the test input, which has 0s, 1s, and 8s, I can choose to replace 8s with, say, 4, and set the area with 1s to 0s.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n- The 1s are in rows 9-11, columns 6-8.\n\n- So, set these to 0s.\n\n- Replace all 8s with 4s.\n\nBut need to verify if this is consistent with training examples.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- 1s in rows 10-12, columns 1-3.\n\n- Output sets these to 0s and replaces 8s with 2s.\n\nSimilarly in other examples.\n\nSo, the general pattern seems to be:\n\n- Identify the cluster of 1s.\n\n- Set that cluster to 0s.\n\n- Replace all 8s that are not adjacent or connected to the 1s cluster with a new number.\n\nWait, but in the outputs, all 8s are replaced, not just those not connected to 1s.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 8s are replaced everywhere, except where 1s are.\n\nBut in the output, the area with 1s is set to 0s, and the 8s are replaced with 2s elsewhere.\n\nWait, but in the output, all 8s are replaced with 2s, and the area with 1s is set to 0s.\n\nSo, it's a two-step process:\n\n1. Set all 1s and possibly their adjacent cells to 0s.\n\n2. Replace all 8s with a new number.\n\nBut in the training outputs, after setting the 1s area to 0s, all remaining 8s are replaced with a new number.\n\nGiven that, in the test input, I should:\n\n1. Set the area with 1s (rows 9-11, columns 6-8) to 0s.\n\n2. Replace all remaining 8s with a new number not present in the input, say 4.\n\nBut need to ensure that the replacement number is consistent across the grid.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, the replacement number is different in each example (2,3,7,etc.), so it seems arbitrary as long as it's not present in the input.\n\nTherefore, for the test input, I can choose 4 as the replacement number for 8s.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Set all 1s and their adjacent cells to 0s.\n\n2. Replace all 8s with 4s.\n\nWait, but in the training examples, only the 1s area is set to 0s, not necessarily their adjacent cells.\n\nIn Example 0, the 1s are in rows 10-12, columns 1-3, and only those cells are set to 0s in the output, the adjacent cells remain as 0s or 8s (replaced with 2s).\n\nSo, perhaps only the 1s are set to 0s, and the 8s are replaced elsewhere.\n\nTherefore, in the test input:\n\n- Set the 1s in rows 9-11, columns 6-8 to 0s.\n\n- Replace all 8s with 4s.\n\nBut need to confirm if there are any 8s adjacent to the 1s that should not be replaced.\n\nIn Example 0, the 8s adjacent to the 1s area are replaced with 2s, as long as they are not in the 1s area.\n\nSo, in the test input, I should replace all 8s with 4s, except those in the 1s area, which are set to 0s.\n\nWait, but in the test input, there are no 8s in the same row and column as the 1s, so all 8s can be replaced with 4s.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n- 1s are in rows 9-11, columns 6-8.\n\n- 8s are in rows 2-5, columns 6-13.\n\nSo, no overlap.\n\nTherefore, set the 1s to 0s and replace all 8s with 4s.\n\nHence, the output should be:\n\n- Rows 9-11, columns 6-8 set to 0s.\n\n- All 8s replaced with 4s.\n\nTherefore, the output grid would have:\n\n- Original 0s remain 0s.\n\n- Original 1s set to 0s.\n\n- Original 8s set to 4s.\n\nSo, the final output is a grid where:\n\n- All 1s are set to 0s.\n\n- All 8s are set to 4s.\n\n- All other cells remain 0s.\n\nThus, the JSON array for the output would reflect this transformation.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to transform the given input grid based on specific rules derived from the training examples. The goal is to replace all occurrences of the number 8 with a new number (chosen to be 4 in this case, as it's not present in the input) and set all occurrences of the number 1 to 0.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Areas to Modify**:\n   - Locate all cells containing the number 1 and set them to 0.\n   - Replace all cells containing the number 8 with 4.\n\n2. **Implement Transformation**:\n   - Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n   - If a cell contains 1, set it to 0.\n   - If a cell contains 8, set it to 4.\n   - Leave all other cells unchanged.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef transform_grid(input_grid):\n    # Choose a new number for replacement, e.g., 4\n    replacement_number = 4\n    output_grid = []\n    \n    for row in input_grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for cell in row:\n            if cell == 1:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            elif cell == 8:\n                new_row.append(replacement_number)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(cell)\n        output_grid.append(new_row)\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_grid = [\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 8],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n]\n\noutput_grid = transform_grid(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Identify and Modify Cells**:\n   - We iterate through each row and each cell in the grid.\n   - If a cell contains 1, it is set to 0.\n   - If a cell contains 8, it is set to 4.\n   - All other cells remain unchanged.\n\n2. **Construct Output Grid**:\n   - We build a new grid (`output_grid`) with the transformed values.\n   - This grid is then returned as the final output.\n\nThis approach ensures that the transformation rules observed in the training examples are applied consistently to the test input.", 'final_json': None, 'retries': 0, 'task_id': '20241222_221654'}
