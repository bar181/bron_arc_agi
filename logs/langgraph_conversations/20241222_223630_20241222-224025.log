Raw model response:
I'm going to solve this puzzle step by step, making sure I understand the pattern from the training examples and then applying it to the test input.

First, I need to look at the training examples and see what transformation is being applied from input to output.

Looking at Example 0:

INPUT:

- A grid of arrays, mostly consisting of 1s and 0s, with some 2s in the middle sections.

OUTPUT:

- Similar grid, but with more 2s introduced in a specific pattern.

Comparing input and output:

- The output seems to have propagated the 2s from the initial positions in the input to neighboring positions in a certain way.

In Example 1:

INPUT:

- A grid with 1s, 0s, and a pair of 3s in the middle.

OUTPUT:

- The output has more 3s spread out in a similar manner as the 2s in Example 0.

From these, it seems like the task is to propagate a certain number (2 in Example 0, 3 in Example 1) from its initial positions to all connected positions through a grid, where connection is defined by adjacent cells with non-zero values.

Wait, but in both examples, the propagation seems to happen in a specific direction or pattern, not just simple flood fill.

Looking closer:

In Example 0, the initial 2s are in positions 7 and 8 in one row, and this seems to trigger a change in multiple rows below.

Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s in positions 12 and 13 trigger changes in multiple rows.

It appears that when a certain pattern is detected in a row, it affects not only that row but also propagates to subsequent rows.

Let me try to formalize this.

Observation:

- The grid has a repeating pattern of rows: two rows with 1s and 0s, followed by a row of 0s.

- In the input, occasionally, there are rows with 2s or 3s in them.

- In the output, these 2s or 3s seem to "spread" to other rows below, following a certain rule.

Hypothesis:

- Whenever there are two consecutive 2s (or 3s) in a row, it causes all subsequent rows with non-zero values to be changed to the same number, until the next row of zeros.

- Additionally, the row where the initial change occurs also gets fully updated to that number.

Let me test this hypothesis against the training examples.

In Example 0:

- The initial row with 2s is row 6 and 7.

- From there, all subsequent rows with non-zero values are changed to 2s in the output.

Wait, but that doesn't seem accurate. Looking again:

- In the input of Example 0, rows 6 and 7 have 2s.

- In the output, rows 6,7,14,15,16,17,18,19 have 2s.

- Rows 14-19 seem to have all 2s, regardless of their original values.

This doesn't完全 match my hypothesis.

Alternative approach:

Maybe it's about vertical patterns. Let's consider vertical columns.

Looking at the columns where 2s appear in the input, and see how they affect the output.

In Example 0, the 2s are in columns 7 and 8 in rows 6 and 7.

In the output, columns 7 and 8 in rows 6,7,14,15,16,17,18,19 have 2s.

Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s are in columns 12 and 13 in rows 14 and 15.

In the output, columns 12 and 13 in rows 14,15,16,17,18,19 have 3s.

It seems that when two consecutive rows have the same number in the same columns, it causes those columns in all subsequent rows to be set to that number, until the next row of zeros.

Wait, but in Example 0, rows 6 and 7 have 2s in columns 7 and 8, and this affects rows 6,7,14,15,16,17,18,19.

Wait, rows 14 and 15 also have 2s in columns 7 and 8 in the output.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the pattern is that once two consecutive rows have the same number in the same columns, all rows below, in those columns, are set to that number, until a row of zeros is encountered.

But in Example 0, rows 6 and 7 have 2s in columns 7 and 8.

Then in rows 14 and 15, which are below, and separated by rows of zeros, also have 2s in columns 7 and 8.

Wait, perhaps it's about vertical strips.

Wait, perhaps, whenever there are two consecutive rows with the same number in the same columns, and these are separated by rows of zeros, then all rows between them also get those columns set to that number.

Wait, but in Example 0, rows 6 and 7 have 2s in columns 7 and 8, and then rows 14 and 15 also have 2s in columns 7 and 8.

But rows 6 to 14 have rows of zeros in between.

Wait, perhaps it's about connecting the dots between two occurrences of the same pattern separated by rows of zeros.

This seems complicated. Maybe I need to look for a different pattern.

Let me try to look at it differently.

Perhaps it's about propagating changes downward from rows that have duplicates in certain positions.

Wait, in Example 0, rows 6 and 7 have 2s in the same columns, and this causes all rows below, in those columns, to be set to 2s, until the end.

Similarly, in Example 1, rows 14 and 15 have 3s in the same columns, and this causes all rows below, in those columns, to be set to 3s, until the end.

Yes, this seems consistent.

So, the rule is:

- If two consecutive rows have the same number in the same columns, then all rows below, in those columns, should be set to that number, until the end.

- Additionally, the rows where this pattern is first observed should also be fully updated to that number.

Wait, but in Example 0, rows 6 and 7 have 2s in columns 7 and 8, and then rows 14 and 15 also have 2s in columns 7 and 8 in the output.

Is it possible that the pattern is detected at rows 6 and 7, and then applied to all rows below, in columns 7 and 8?

But in the output, rows 6,7,14,15,16,17,18,19 have 2s in columns 7 and 8.

Wait, perhaps it's that once a column has two consecutive 2s, then all rows below in that column are set to 2s.

Wait, but in Example 0, columns 7 and 8 have two consecutive 2s in rows 6 and 7, and then again in rows 14 and 15.

So, perhaps the rule is:

- For each column, if there are two consecutive 2s (or 3s), then set all cells below those two to 2s (or 3s).

This seems plausible.

Let me test this with Example 0:

- In columns 7 and 8, there are two consecutive 2s in rows 6 and 7.

- Therefore, all rows below, in columns 7 and 8, should be set to 2s.

- Looking at the output, this seems to be the case.

Similarly, in Example 1:

- Columns 12 and 13 have two consecutive 3s in rows 14 and 15.

- Therefore, all rows below, in columns 12 and 13, are set to 3s.

- Looking at the output, this holds true.

So, the general rule is:

- For each column:

- Scan the column from top to bottom.

- If you find two consecutive cells with the same number (and that number is not 0), then set all cells below those two to that number.

- The two initial cells that triggered this change should also be set to that number.

Wait, but in the examples, it seems like only the cells below are changed, not the initial two cells.

Wait, in Example 0, rows 6 and 7 already have 2s, and in the output, they remain 2s.

So, perhaps the initial two cells are already set to that number, and the rule just ensures that all cells below them are set to that number as well.

Wait, but in the input, rows 6 and 7 have 2s, and in the output, they remain 2s, and the rows below them, in the same columns, are also set to 2s.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the rule is:

- For each column:

- If there are two consecutive cells with the same non-zero number, then set all cells below them in that column to that number.

This seems to align with both training examples.

Now, let's apply this rule to the test input.

Test Input:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this input, rows 5 and 6 have 8s in columns 16 and 17.

Therefore, according to the rule, all rows below rows 5 and 6, in columns 16 and 17, should be set to 8s.

So, in the output, columns 16 and 17, from rows 5 onwards, should be 8s.

Let me construct the output step by step.

Start with the original input.

Rows 0 to 4 remain unchanged.

Rows 5 and 6 already have 8s in columns 16 and 17.

Rows 7 to 19 need to have columns 16 and 17 set to 8s.

So, in rows 7 to 19, columns 16 and 17 should be 8s, while the rest remains the same.

Let's construct this.

Row 0: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Row 1: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 2: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Row 3: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Row 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 5: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

Row 6: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

Row 7: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 8: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Row 9: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Row 10: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 11: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Row 12: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Row 13: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 14: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Row 15: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Row 16: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Row 17: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Row 18: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

Row 19: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Now, apply the rule:

- Columns 16 and 17, from rows 5 onwards, should be 8s.

So, for rows 5 to 19, columns 16 and 17 should be 8s.

Let's update the rows accordingly.

Row 5: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

Row 6: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

Row 7: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Row 8: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

Row 9: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

Row 10: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Row 11: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

Row 12: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

Row 13: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Row 14: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

Row 15: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

Row 16: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Row 17: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

Row 18: [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

Row 19: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

Wait, but in rows where the original columns 16 and 17 were 0, we should set them to 8s only if they are below the initial two consecutive non-zero cells.

In rows 7,10,13,16,19, columns 16 and 17 were originally 0, so they should be set to 8s.

In rows 5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18, columns 16 and 17 were originally 8s or 1s, but according to the rule, all rows below the initial two consecutive non-zero cells should have those columns set to 8s.

So, in rows 5 and 6, columns 16 and 17 are 8s.

Then, in rows below, columns 16 and 17 should be set to 8s, regardless of their original values.

Therefore, in rows 7 to 19, columns 16 and 17 should all be 8s.

Wait, but in row 7, columns 16 and 17 were originally 0, so they should be set to 8s.

Similarly, in rows 10,13,16,19, columns 16 and 17 are 0, so they should be set to 8s.

In rows 8,9,11,12,14,15,17,18, columns 16 and 17 were originally 1s, so they should be set to 8s.

So, in the output, columns 16 and 17, from row 5 onwards, should all be 8s.

Let me confirm this.

- Rows 0 to 4: no change.

- Rows 5 and 6: columns 16 and 17 are already 8s.

- Rows 7 to 19: columns 16 and 17 should be set to 8s.

Therefore, in the output, columns 16 and 17, from row 5 onwards, are all 8s.

Now, let's construct the output array accordingly.

Output:

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0]

This should be the correct output based on the identified pattern.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to identify and apply a specific pattern transformation to the input data based on the provided training examples. The goal is to process the test input according to the observed rules and generate the corresponding output.

### Approach

1. **Pattern Identification**:
   - Examine the training examples to understand how the input is transformed into the output.
   - Identify that the transformation involves propagating certain numbers (like 2, 3, or 8) downwards in specific columns once they appear consecutively in two rows.

2. **Rule Formulation**:
   - For each column, if two consecutive rows contain the same non-zero number, set all cells below these two in the same column to that number.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Iterate through each column of the input matrix.
   - For each column, scan from top to bottom to find the first occurrence of two consecutive identical non-zero numbers.
   - Set all cells below these two to that number.

### Solution Code

```python
def transform_input(input_grid):

step, making sure I understand the pattern from the training examples and then applying it to the test input.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the training examples and see what transformation is being applied from input to output.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nINPUT:\n\n- A grid of arrays, mostly consisting of 1s and 0s, with some 2s in the middle sections.\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n- Similar grid, but with more 2s introduced in a specific pattern.\n\nComparing input and output:\n\n- The output seems to have propagated the 2s from the initial positions in the input to neighboring positions in a certain way.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nINPUT:\n\n- A grid with 1s, 0s, and a pair of 3s in the middle.\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n- The output has more 3s spread out in a similar manner as the 2s in Example 0.\n\nFrom these, it seems like the task is to propagate a certain number (2 in Example 0, 3 in Example 1) from its initial positions to all connected positions through a grid, where connection is defined by adjacent cells with non-zero values.\n\nWait, but in both examples, the propagation seems to happen in a specific direction or pattern, not just simple flood fill.\n\nLooking closer:\n\nIn Example 0, the initial 2s are in positions 7 and 8 in one row, and this seems to trigger a change in multiple rows below.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the 3s in positions 12 and 13 trigger changes in multiple rows.\n\nIt appears that when a certain pattern is detected in a row, it affects not only that row but also propagates to subsequent rows.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nObservation:\n\n- The grid has a repeating pattern of rows: two rows with 1s and 0s, followed by a row of 0s.\n\n- In the input, occasionally, there are rows with 2s or 3s in them.\n\n- In the output, these 2s or 3s seem to "spread" to other rows below, following a certain rule.\n\nHypothesis:\n\n- Whenever there are two consecutive 2s (or 3s) in a row, it causes all subsequent rows with non-zero values to be changed to the same number, until the next row of zeros.\n\n- Additionally, the row where the initial change occurs also gets fully updated to that number.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis against the training examples.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- The initial row with 2s is row 6 and 7.\n\n- From there, all subsequent rows with non-zero values are changed to 2s in the output.\n\nWait, but that doesn\'t seem accurate. Looking again:\n\n- In the input of Example 0, rows 6 and 7 have 2s.\n\n- In the output, rows 6,7,14,15,16,17,18,19 have 2s.\n\n- Rows 14-19 seem to have all 2s, regardless of their original values.\n\nThis doesn\'t完全 match my hypothesis.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nMaybe it\'s about vertical patterns. Let\'s consider vertical columns.\n\nLooking at the columns where 2s appear in the input, and see how they affect the output.\n\nIn Example 0, the 2s are in columns 7 and 8 in rows 6 and 7.\n\nIn the output, columns 7 and 8 in rows 6,7,14,15,16,17,18,19 have 2s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the 3s are in columns 12 and 13 in rows 14 and 15.\n\nIn the output, columns 12 and 13 in rows 14,15,16,17,18,19 have 3s.\n\nIt seems that when two consecutive rows have the same number in the same columns, it causes those columns in all subsequent rows to be set to that number, until the next row of zeros.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, rows 6 and 7 have 2s in columns 7 and 8, and this affects rows 6,7,14,15,16,17,18,19.\n\nWait, rows 14 and 15 also have 2s in columns 7 and 8 in the output.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that once two consecutive rows have the same number in the same columns, all rows below, in those columns, are set to that number, until a row of zeros is encountered.\n\nBut in Example 0, rows 6 and 7 have 2s in columns 7 and 8.\n\nThen in rows 14 and 15, which are below, and separated by rows of zeros, also have 2s in columns 7 and 8.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s about vertical strips.\n\nWait, perhaps, whenever there are two consecutive rows with the same number in the same columns, and these are separated by rows of zeros, then all rows between them also get those columns set to that number.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, rows 6 and 7 have 2s in columns 7 and 8, and then rows 14 and 15 also have 2s in columns 7 and 8.\n\nBut rows 6 to 14 have rows of zeros in between.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s about connecting the dots between two occurrences of the same pattern separated by rows of zeros.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe I need to look for a different pattern.\n\nLet me try to look at it differently.\n\nPerhaps it\'s about propagating changes downward from rows that have duplicates in certain positions.\n\nWait, in Example 0, rows 6 and 7 have 2s in the same columns, and this causes all rows below, in those columns, to be set to 2s, until the end.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, rows 14 and 15 have 3s in the same columns, and this causes all rows below, in those columns, to be set to 3s, until the end.\n\nYes, this seems consistent.\n\nSo, the rule is:\n\n- If two consecutive rows have the same number in the same columns, then all rows below, in those columns, should be set to that number, until the end.\n\n- Additionally, the rows where this pattern is first observed should also be fully updated to that number.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, rows 6 and 7 have 2s in columns 7 and 8, and then rows 14 and 15 also have 2s in columns 7 and 8 in the output.\n\nIs it possible that the pattern is detected at rows 6 and 7, and then applied to all rows below, in columns 7 and 8?\n\nBut in the output, rows 6,7,14,15,16,17,18,19 have 2s in columns 7 and 8.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s that once a column has two consecutive 2s, then all rows below in that column are set to 2s.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, columns 7 and 8 have two consecutive 2s in rows 6 and 7, and then again in rows 14 and 15.\n\nSo, perhaps the rule is:\n\n- For each column, if there are two consecutive 2s (or 3s), then set all cells below those two to 2s (or 3s).\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nLet me test this with Example 0:\n\n- In columns 7 and 8, there are two consecutive 2s in rows 6 and 7.\n\n- Therefore, all rows below, in columns 7 and 8, should be set to 2s.\n\n- Looking at the output, this seems to be the case.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1:\n\n- Columns 12 and 13 have two consecutive 3s in rows 14 and 15.\n\n- Therefore, all rows below, in columns 12 and 13, are set to 3s.\n\n- Looking at the output, this holds true.\n\nSo, the general rule is:\n\n- For each column:\n\n- Scan the column from top to bottom.\n\n- If you find two consecutive cells with the same number (and that number is not 0), then set all cells below those two to that number.\n\n- The two initial cells that triggered this change should also be set to that number.\n\nWait, but in the examples, it seems like only the cells below are changed, not the initial two cells.\n\nWait, in Example 0, rows 6 and 7 already have 2s, and in the output, they remain 2s.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial two cells are already set to that number, and the rule just ensures that all cells below them are set to that number as well.\n\nWait, but in the input, rows 6 and 7 have 2s, and in the output, they remain 2s, and the rows below them, in the same columns, are also set to 2s.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the rule is:\n\n- For each column:\n\n- If there are two consecutive cells with the same non-zero number, then set all cells below them in that column to that number.\n\nThis seems to align with both training examples.\n\nNow, let\'s apply this rule to the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1,

The goal is to process the test input according to the observed rules and generate the corresponding output.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Pattern Identification**:\n   - Examine the training examples to understand how the input is transformed into the output.\n   - Identify that the transformation involves propagating certain numbers (like 2, 3, or 8) downwards in specific columns once they appear consecutively in two rows.\n\n2. **Rule Formulation**:\n   - For each column, if two consecutive rows contain the same non-zero number, set all cells below these two in the same column to that number.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   - Iterate through each column of the input matrix.\n   - For each column, scan from top to bottom to find the first occurrence of two consecutive identical non-zero numbers.\n   - Set all cells below these two to that number.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef transform_input(input_grid):\n    if not input_grid:\n        return []\n    \n    rows = len(input_grid)\n    cols = len(input_grid[0])\n    \n    # Create a copy of the input grid to modify\n    output_grid = [list(row) for row in input_grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each column\n    for c in range(cols):\n        found_consecutive = False\n        target_value = None\n        # Scan from top to bottom\n        for r in range(rows - 1):\n            if input_grid[r][c] == input_grid[r+1][c] and input_grid[r][c] != 0:\n                found_consecutive = True\n                target_value = input_grid[r][c]\n                break  # Only need the first occurrence\n        \n        # If consecutive identical non-zero values found, set all below to that value\n        if found_consecutive:\n            for r in range(r, rows):\n                output_grid[r][c] = target_value\n    \n    return output_grid\n\n# Example test input\ntest_input = [\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1],\n    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n    [1, 1, 0, 1,', 'final_json': None, 'retries': 0, 'task_id': '20241222_223630'}
