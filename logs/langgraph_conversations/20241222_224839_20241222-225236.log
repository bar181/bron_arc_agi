Raw model response:
I need to solve this ARC task. Let's see what's going on here.

First, I have some training examples with inputs and outputs. I need to find the pattern that transforms the input into the output and then apply that pattern to the test input.

Looking at Example 0:

Input:

- A grid of numbers, mostly 0s, with some groups of numbers like 4, 8, 3, and 5.

Output:

- Similar grid, but some numbers have spread or filled in areas.

Hmm, it seems like the numbers are expanding or filling in adjacent areas.

Let me look closer.

In the input, there are isolated groups of numbers:

- A horizontal line of 4s

- A horizontal line of 8s

- A horizontal line of 3s

- A horizontal line of 5s

In the output, these groups have expanded:

- The 4s have expanded upwards and downwards.

- The 8s have expanded to the right.

- The 3s have expanded upwards.

- The 5s remain the same.

Wait, the 5s are on the bottom and haven't changed.

Similarly, in Example 1:

Input:

- Groups of 5, 2, 3, 7.

Output:

- These groups have expanded in certain directions.

It seems like the numbers are filling in the areas around them, perhaps based on their shape.

Let me think about how this works.

Maybe it's a flooding or filling algorithm, where each group of numbers expands to fill contiguous empty spaces.

But in these examples, it's not just filling empty spaces; it's expanding the number areas to cover more cells, kind of like growing regions.

Another thought: It's similar to painting areas, where each number represents a different color, and the colors spread to adjacent cells.

But how do I determine the direction and extent of the spread?

Looking back at Example 0:

The 4s expand upwards and downwards to fill the columns.

The 8s expand to the right to fill the rows.

The 3s expand upwards.

The 5s remain unchanged, perhaps because they are already at the bottom.

Wait, in Example 1:

The 5s are on the right and remain unchanged.

The 2s expand to the left.

The 3s expand to the right.

The 7s expand upwards.

So, perhaps the numbers expand in certain directions based on their position relative to the border.

Alternatively, maybe they expand in all directions, but are constrained by existing non-zero numbers.

But in Example 0, the 4s expand upwards into the 8s, but in Example 1, the 3s expand right into the 7s.

Wait, in Example 1, the 3s are below the 7s, and they expand right into the 7s.

In that case, it seems like the expansion happens in the direction of the adjacent non-zero number.

Wait, but in Example 0, the 4s expand upwards into the 8s, and the 3s expand upwards into the 4s.

So perhaps, the numbers expand towards the nearest non-zero neighbor.

But that seems a bit vague.

Let me try another approach.

Looking at the output, it seems like each group of numbers has expanded to cover more cells, filling in the gaps between them.

Perhaps it's a matter of each number expanding to fill the entire area between other numbers.

Wait, in Example 0, the 4s expand to fill the columns between the 8s and the 3s.

Similarly, in Example 1, the 3s expand to meet the 7s.

It's almost like each number is expanding to meet the adjacent numbers, filling in the space between them.

But I need a more concrete rule.

Let's consider the test input:

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

...

[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

[4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

...

[0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

...

So, there are horizontal lines of 5s, 4s, and 3s, and some 8s and 2s.

Based on the pattern from the training examples, I need to expand these number groups to fill in the areas between them.

Let me try to generalize the rule:

- Each group of numbers expands to fill the area up to the next non-zero number in certain directions.

- The expansion seems to happen in the vertical direction for horizontal groups and horizontal direction for vertical groups.

Wait, but all groups are horizontal in these examples.

Wait, in Example 2:

Input:

- Vertical line of 5s.

- Horizontal line of 3s.

- Horizontal line of 2s.

- Horizontal line of 6s.

Output:

- The 5s remain.

- The 3s expand to the left.

- The 2s expand upwards.

- The 6s expand in multiple directions.

Wait, in Example 2, the 5s are vertical, and they don't expand.

The 3s are horizontal and expand left.

The 2s are single rows and expand upwards.

The 6s expand to fill the area between 2s and 3s.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to think in terms of regions bounded by non-zero numbers.

Each group of non-zero numbers defines a region, and within that region, the numbers expand to fill the space.

But I need a better way to model this.

Another idea: For each non-zero cell, propagate its value to adjacent zero cells until bounded by other non-zero cells.

Like a flooding algorithm, where each non-zero group floods into zeros until it meets another non-zero group.

In this case, the flooding stops at the boundary of the next non-zero group.

Let me try applying this to Example 0.

In Example 0:

- The 8s are on top, expand downwards until they meet the 4s.

- The 4s expand upwards to meet the 8s and downwards to meet the 3s.

- The 3s expand upwards to meet the 4s.

- The 5s are at the bottom and don't expand.

This seems consistent with a flooding approach where each group expands into zeros until it meets another group.

Similarly, in Example 1:

- The 5s are on the right, don't expand.

- The 2s expand left until they meet the 7s.

- The 3s expand right until they meet the 7s.

- The 7s expand upwards.

Wait, but in Example 1, the 7s expand upwards, filling more rows.

Is there a specific direction for expansion based on the position?

Wait, perhaps the expansion happens from the center of the group outward, filling zeros until bounded by other non-zero groups.

But I need a more precise rule.

Let's consider the test input.

Test Input:

- Top row of 5s.

- Several rows of 0s.

- One row of 4s.

- More rows of 0s.

- One row with some 8s.

- More rows of 0s.

- One row of 2s.

- More rows of 0s.

- One row of 3s.

- More rows of 0s.

So, I need to expand these groups into the zero areas.

Based on the training examples, it seems that horizontal lines expand horizontally, and vertical lines expand vertically.

Wait, but in Example 2, the 5s are vertical and don't expand.

Wait, maybe vertical lines don't expand, only horizontal lines do.

But in Example 0, the 4s are horizontal and expand vertically.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the expansion direction is perpendicular to the group's orientation.

- Horizontal groups expand vertically.

- Vertical groups expand horizontally.

But in Example 0, the 8s are horizontal and expand vertically.

The 4s are horizontal and expand vertically.

The 3s are horizontal and expand vertically.

The 5s are horizontal and don't expand.

Wait, but in the test input, the 5s are horizontal.

Wait, perhaps the expansion happens towards the direction of the nearest non-zero group.

Wait, I need a better approach.

Maybe I should think in terms of priority or order of expansion.

Assuming that higher numbers have higher priority.

Wait, but numbers are just identifiers; their numerical value might not indicate priority.

Alternatively, perhaps the expansion happens simultaneously, and the boundaries are where two expansions meet.

Like pouring different colored liquids into a container and watching them meet at interfaces.

In computing terms, it's similar to region growing or watershed algorithms in image processing.

But I need to implement this in a simple, step-by-step manner.

Let me try the following approach:

1. Identify all distinct non-zero groups in the input.

2. For each group, propagate its number into adjacent zero cells until encountering another non-zero group.

3. Repeat this propagation for all groups simultaneously, effectively filling the zeros with the nearest non-zero group's number.

This sounds similar to a multi-source flooding algorithm, where each non-zero group is a source that floods into zeros.

In practice, this can be implemented using a breadth-first search (BFS) from each non-zero group, updating the zeros with the group's number until boundaries are met with other groups.

Let's try applying this to Example 0.

In Example 0:

- Groups: 8s (row 6), 4s (row 3), 3s (rows 12-14), 5s (row 15).

- Propagate 8s downwards until meeting 4s.

- Propagate 4s upwards to meet 8s and downwards to meet 3s.

- Propagate 3s upwards to meet 4s.

- 5s remain as they are, since they are at the bottom.

This matches the output of Example 0.

Similarly, in Example 1:

- Groups: 5s (rightmost column), 2s (rows 1-2), 3s (rows 5-7), 7s (rows 8-11).

- Propagate 5s leftwards.

- Propagate 2s leftwards to meet 7s.

- Propagate 3s rightwards to meet 7s.

- Propagate 7s upwards.

This seems consistent.

In Example 2:

- Groups: 5s (vertical on the left), 3s (row 5), 2s (row 11), 6s (rows 6-7).

- Propagate 5s rightwards.

- Propagate 3s leftwards to meet 5s.

- Propagate 2s upwards to meet 6s.

- Propagate 6s in multiple directions.

Again, this matches the output.

So, this approach seems promising.

Now, applying this to the test input:

Test Input:

- Top row: 5s (row 0).

- Several rows of 0s.

- Row 4: 4s.

- More 0s.

- Row 6: 8s.

- More 0s.

- Row 12: 2s.

- More 0s.

- Row 16: 3s.

- More 0s.

So, the non-zero groups are:

- 5s (row 0).

- 4s (row 4).

- 8s (row 6).

- 2s (row 12).

- 3s (row 16).

I need to propagate these groups into the zero rows between them.

Let's consider the spaces between the groups:

- Between 5s and 4s: rows 1-3.

- Between 4s and 8s: rows 5.

- Between 8s and 2s: rows 7-11.

- Between 2s and 3s: rows 13-15.

- Below 3s: rows 17-18.

I need to decide how to assign the numbers in these rows based on the neighboring groups.

According to the flooding approach:

- Propagate 5s downwards to meet the 4s.

- Propagate 4s upwards to meet 5s and downwards to meet 8s.

- Propagate 8s upwards to meet 4s and downwards to meet 2s.

- Propagate 2s upwards to meet 8s and downwards to meet 3s.

- Propagate 3s upwards to meet 2s.

- The bottom rows remain as 0s since there are no other groups below.

Let's assign the rows accordingly:

- Rows 0-4: 5s propagate downwards.

- Rows 4-6: 4s propagate upwards to meet 5s and downwards to meet 8s.

- Rows 6-12: 8s propagate upwards to meet 4s and downwards to meet 2s.

- Rows 12-16: 2s propagate upwards to meet 8s and downwards to meet 3s.

- Rows 16-18: 3s propagate upwards to meet 2s.

So, in terms of which group occupies which rows:

- Rows 0-4: 5s.

- Rows 4-6: 4s.

- Rows 6-12: 8s.

- Rows 12-16: 2s.

- Rows 16-18: 3s.

Wait, but in this assignment, there are overlapping rows where groups meet.

Specifically:

- Row 4: 4s and 5s meet.

- Row 6: 8s and 4s meet.

- Row 12: 2s and 8s meet.

- Row 16: 3s and 2s meet.

I need to define how the boundaries are handled.

In the flooding algorithm, the boundary is where the influence of two groups meets.

Perhaps I can assign the rows based on which group is closer.

But in this grid, since it's a 2D grid, I need to consider both rows and columns.

Wait, but in this test input, all non-zero groups are horizontal lines in specific rows.

So, perhaps the expansion happens vertically, with each group expanding to cover the rows between them.

In that case:

- 5s expand downwards to row 4.

- 4s expand upwards to meet 5s and downwards to meet 8s.

- 8s expand upwards to meet 4s and downwards to meet 2s.

- 2s expand upwards to meet 8s and downwards to meet 3s.

- 3s expand upwards to meet 2s.

So, in rows 1-3: 5s.

Row 4: 4s.

Row 5: 4s.

Rows 6-11: 8s.

Rows 12-15: 2s.

Row 16: 3s.

Row 17-18: 3s.

Wait, but in row 4, it's 4s, which is already defined.

So, the expansion would fill:

- Rows 1-3: 5s.

- Row 4: 4s.

- Rows 5-11: 8s.

- Rows 12-15: 2s.

- Rows 16-18: 3s.

But in the original input, row 6 has some 8s and row 12 has 2s, etc.

Wait, but in the test input, row 5 has some 8s, but in my assignment, rows 6-11 should be 8s.

Wait, let's check the test input again.

Wait, in the test input:

Row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]

Row 6: [4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Wait, row 5 has some 8s on the right.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the rows.

Let me re-examine the test input.

Test Input:

Row 0: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]

Row 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]

Row 6: [4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 11: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 14: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 15: [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 17: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Row 18: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Okay, so non-zero rows are:

- Row 0: 5s

- Row 5: partial 8s

- Row 6: 4s

- Row 11: partial 2s

- Row 15: 3s

So, perhaps I need to adjust my earlier assumption.

Now, considering this:

- The 5s are on row 0.

- The 4s are on row 6.

- The 8s are on row 5.

- The 2s are on row 11.

- The 3s are on row 15.

I need to propagate these groups into the zero rows between them.

Let's consider the spaces:

- Between 5s and 8s: rows 1-4.

- Between 8s and 4s: row 5-6.

- Between 4s and 2s: rows 7-10.

- Between 2s and 3s: rows 12-14.

- Below 3s: rows 16-18.

So, I need to assign the propagation accordingly.

Let's try:

- Propagate 5s downwards to meet the 8s.

- Propagate 8s upwards to meet 5s and downwards to meet 4s.

- Propagate 4s upwards to meet 8s and downwards to meet 2s.

- Propagate 2s upwards to meet 4s and downwards to meet 3s.

- Propagate 3s upwards to meet 2s.

This would mean:

- Rows 1-4: 5s.

- Rows 5-6: 8s.

- Rows 7-10: 4s.

- Rows 11-14: 2s.

- Rows 15-18: 3s.

But in row 5, there are already some 8s present, so that seems consistent.

Similarly, in row 11, there are 2s present.

So, perhaps this is the way to go.

Let me fill in the grid based on this:

Rows 0-4: 5s.

Row 5: 8s (existing 8s, rest 0s).

Row 6: 4s.

Rows 7-10: 4s.

Row 11: 2s.

Rows 12-14: 2s.

Row 15: 3s.

Rows 16-18: 3s.

But in the original input, row 5 has only partial 8s, and row 11 has partial 2s.

So, in the output, I need to expand these numbers to fill the rows.

Wait, but in the training examples, the expansion seems to respect the existing numbers and fills in the zeros accordingly.

So, in row 5, which has some 8s, I need to propagate the 8s to the left to fill the zeros until they meet the 5s above.

Similarly, in row 11, propagate the 2s to the left to fill until they meet the 4s above.

Wait, but in row 5, the 8s are on the right, so they should propagate leftwards to meet the 5s above.

Similarly, in row 11, the 2s are in the middle, so they should propagate leftwards and rightwards to fill the zeros.

But in row 5, there are only 8s on the right, so propagating left would fill the zeros to the left with 8s.

Similarly, in row 11, the 2s are in the middle, so propagating left and right would fill the zeros around them with 2s.

Wait, but in row 5, there are 8s at columns 14-16.

So, propagate 8s leftwards to fill columns 0-13 with 8s, meeting the 5s above.

But in row 5, the 8s are at columns 14-16, and the rest are 0s.

So, propagating 8s leftwards would fill columns 0-13 with 8s.

But in the rows above, rows 0-4 are 5s.

So, in row 5, columns 0-13: 5s, columns 14-16: 8s, column 17: 0.

Wait, but according to the flooding approach, the 5s would propagate downwards to meet the 8s in row 5.

Similarly, the 8s would propagate upwards to meet the 5s.

So, in row 5, the 5s and 8s would meet at some boundary.

But in the input, row 5 has only partial 8s on the right.

So, perhaps the 8s expand leftwards to meet the 5s.

Similarly, in row 11, the 2s expand leftwards and rightwards to fill the zeros.

This seems consistent.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

First, identify all non-zero groups:

- Row 0: 5s (columns 0-17).

- Row 5: 8s (columns 14-16).

- Row 6: 4s (columns 0-3).

- Row 11: 2s (columns 7-11).

- Row 15: 3s (columns 6-12).

Now, propagate these groups into the zero areas.

Starting with the 5s:

- Propagate downwards from row 0 to row 4.

- In row 5, propagate leftwards from the 8s to meet the 5s.

Wait, but the 8s are on the right in row 5.

So, the 8s should propagate leftwards to meet the 5s.

Similarly, the 5s propagate downwards to meet the 8s.

So, in row 5, the 5s and 8s meet.

Perhaps the boundary is at the existing 8s in columns 14-16.

So, columns 0-13: 5s, columns 14-16: 8s.

Similarly, in row 6, the 4s are in columns 0-3.

Propagate the 4s downwards to meet the 2s in row 11.

Wait, but there are zeros between row 6 and row 11.

So, propagate 4s downwards to row 11.

But row 11 has 2s in columns 7-11.

So, the 4s would propagate downwards until they meet the 2s.

Similarly, the 2s propagate upwards to meet the 4s.

So, in rows 7-10, fill with 4s.

In rows 12-14, fill with 2s.

Similarly, the 8s in row 5 propagate downwards to meet the 4s in row 6.

Wait, but row 6 has 4s in columns 0-3.

So, in row 5, columns 0-13: 5s, columns 14-16: 8s.

In row 6, columns 0-3: 4s, columns 4-13: 8s, columns 14-16: 8s.

Wait, perhaps I need to align the expansions properly.

This is getting a bit complicated.

Maybe I should think column-wise as well.

Looking at columns:

- Columns where non-zero numbers are present.

For example, in column 0:

- Row 0: 5

- Rows 1-4: 0

- Row 5: 0

- Row 6: 4

- Rows 7-10: 0

- Row 11: 0

- Rows 12-14: 0

- Row 15: 0

- Rows 16-18: 0

So, in column 0:

- 5s propagate downwards from row 0 to row 6.

- In row 6, it meets the 4s.

So, rows 0-5: 5s, row 6: 4s, rows 7-18: 4s.

Wait, but in row 6, columns 4-13 are zeros, which should be filled with 4s.

Wait, perhaps I need to propagate each group's number into the zeros until it meets another group.

In other words, perform a flood fill from each non-zero group into the zeros.

To implement this, I can use a BFS approach starting from each non-zero cell.

But since this is a thought process, I'll try to simulate it mentally.

First, mark all non-zero cells as sources.

Then, propagate their values into adjacent zeros, level by level, until all zeros are filled.

In this way, each zero cell will take the value of the nearest non-zero neighbor.

In case of a tie, prioritize the group that reaches first.

But in practice, I need to ensure that different groups don't overwrite each other's expansions.

Given the complexity, perhaps I can accept that my current approach is sufficient and proceed to fill in the grid accordingly.

So, based on the earlier assignment:

- Rows 0-4: 5s.

- Row 5: 5s in columns 0-13, 8s in columns 14-16.

- Row 6: 4s in columns 0-3, 8s in columns 4-13, 8s in columns 14-16.

- Rows 7-10: 4s.

- Row 11: 4s in columns 0-6, 2s in columns 7-11, 4s in columns 12-17.

- Rows 12-14: 2s.

- Row 15: 2s in columns 0-5, 3s in columns 6-12, 2s in columns 13-17.

- Rows 16-18: 3s.

This is just a rough estimation, and may not be entirely accurate, but it's a start.

Now, let's try to fill in the grid step by step.

Starting with row 0:

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]

Row 1: Propagate 5s downwards.

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]

Row 2: Same.

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]

Row 3: Same.

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]

Row 4: Same.

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]

Row 5: Existing 8s in columns 14-16.

So, propagate 5s to the left and 8s to the right.

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,8,8,0]

Wait, but column 17 is 0, and it's adjacent to 8s, so it should become 8.

[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,8,8,8,8]

Row 6: Existing 4s in columns 0-3.

Propagate 4s to the right until they meet the 8s.

[4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]

Wait, but in row 5, columns 14-16 are 8s, so in row 6, columns 4-13 should be 8s.

Wait, perhaps I need to align the boundaries correctly.

In row 5:

Columns 0-13: 5s, columns 14-16: 8s, column 17: 8.

In row 6:

Columns 0-3: 4s, columns 4-13: 8s, columns 14-16: 8s, column 17: 8.

So, [4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]

Row 7: Propagate 4s downwards.

[4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]

Row 8: Same.

[4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]

Row 9: Same.

[4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]

[4,4,4,4,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]

Row 11: Existing 2s in columns 7-11.

Propagate 2s leftwards and rightwards to meet the 4s and 8s.

So, columns 0-6: 4s, columns 7-11: 2s, columns 12-17: 8s.

[4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8]

Row 12: Propagate 2s downwards.

[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8]

Row 13: Same.

[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8]

Row 14: Same.

[2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,8,8,8,8,8,8]

Row 15: Existing 3s in columns 6-12.

Propagate 3s leftwards and rightwards to meet the 2s and 8s.

So, columns 0-5: 2s, columns 6-12: 3s, columns 13-17: 8s.

[2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8]

Row 16: Propagate 3s downwards.

[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8]

Row 17: Same.

[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8]

Row 18: Same.

[3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8]

Wait, but in row 15, columns 13-17 are 8s, which are adjacent to the 3s.

So, in row 16, columns 0-5: 2s, columns 6-12: 3s, columns 13-17: 8s.

But according to the flooding approach, the 3s should expand to meet the 8s.

So, in row 16, columns 0-5: 2s, columns 6-12: 3s, columns 13-17: 8s.

Similarly in row 17 and 18.

So, the final grid would be:

Rows 0-4: All 5s.

Row 5: Columns 0-13: 5s, columns 14-17: 8s.

Row 6: Columns 0-3: 4s, columns 4-17: 8s.

Rows 7-10: All 4s.

Row 11: Columns 0-6: 4s, columns 7-11: 2s, columns 12-17: 8s.

Rows 12-14: All 2s.

Row 15: Columns 0-5: 2s, columns 6-12: 3s, columns 13-17: 8s.

additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})], 'next_step': 'generate', 'current_response': "I need to solve this ARC task. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I have some training examples with inputs and outputs. I need to find the pattern that transforms the input into the output and then apply that pattern to the test input.\n\nLooking at Example 0:\n\nInput:\n\n- A grid of numbers, mostly 0s, with some groups of numbers like 4, 8, 3, and 5.\n\nOutput:\n\n- Similar grid, but some numbers have spread or filled in areas.\n\nHmm, it seems like the numbers are expanding or filling in adjacent areas.\n\nLet me look closer.\n\nIn the input, there are isolated groups of numbers:\n\n- A horizontal line of 4s\n\n- A horizontal line of 8s\n\n- A horizontal line of 3s\n\n- A horizontal line of 5s\n\nIn the output, these groups have expanded:\n\n- The 4s have expanded upwards and downwards.\n\n- The 8s have expanded to the right.\n\n- The 3s have expanded upwards.\n\n- The 5s remain the same.\n\nWait, the 5s are on the bottom and haven't changed.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1:\n\nInput:\n\n- Groups of 5, 2, 3, 7.\n\nOutput:\n\n- These groups have expanded in certain directions.\n\nIt seems like the numbers are filling in the areas around them, perhaps based on their shape.\n\nLet me think about how this works.\n\nMaybe it's a flooding or filling algorithm, where each group of numbers expands to fill contiguous empty spaces.\n\nBut in these examples, it's not just filling empty spaces; it's expanding the number areas to cover more cells, kind of like growing regions.\n\nAnother thought: It's similar to painting areas, where each number represents a different color, and the colors spread to adjacent cells.\n\nBut how do I determine the direction and extent of the spread?\n\nLooking back at Example 0:\n\nThe 4s expand upwards and downwards to fill the columns.\n\nThe 8s expand to the right to fill the rows.\n\nThe 3s expand upwards.\n\nThe 5s remain unchanged, perhaps because they are already at the bottom.\n\nWait, in Example 1:\n\nThe 5s are on the right and remain unchanged.\n\nThe 2s expand to the left.\n\nThe 3s expand to the right.\n\nThe 7s expand upwards.\n\nSo, perhaps the numbers expand in certain directions based on their position relative to the border.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they expand in all directions, but are constrained by existing non-zero numbers.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 4s expand upwards into the 8s, but in Example 1, the 3s expand right into the 7s.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 3s are below the 7s, and they expand right into the 7s.\n\nIn that case, it seems like the expansion happens in the direction of the adjacent non-zero number.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, the 4s expand upwards into the 8s, and the 3s expand upwards into the 4s.\n\nSo perhaps, the numbers expand towards the nearest non-zero neighbor.\n\nBut that seems a bit vague.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nLooking at the output, it seems like each group of numbers has expanded to cover more cells, filling in the gaps between them.\n\nPerhaps it's a matter of each number expanding to fill the entire area between other numbers.\n\nWait, in Example 0, the 4s expand to fill the columns between the 8s and the 3s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1, the 3s expand to meet the 7s.\n\nIt's almost like each number is expanding to meet the adjacent numbers, filling in the space between them.\n\nBut I need a more concrete rule.\n\nLet's consider the test input:\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n...\n\n[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n...\n\n[0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\n...\n\nSo, there are horizontal lines of 5s, 4s, and 3s, and some 8s and 2s.\n\nBased on the pattern from the training examples, I need to expand these number groups to fill in the areas between them.\n\nLet me try to generalize the rule:\n\n- Each group of numbers expands to fill the area up to the next non-zero number in certain directions.\n\n- The expansion seems to happen in the vertical direction for horizontal groups and horizontal direction for vertical groups.\n\nWait, but all groups are horizontal in these examples.\n\nWait, in Example 2:\n\nInput:\n\n- Vertical line of 5s.\n\n- Horizontal line of 3s.\n\n- Horizontal line of 2s.\n\n- Horizontal line of 6s.\n\nOutput:\n\n- The 5s remain.\n\n- The 3s expand to the left.\n\n- The 2s expand upwards.\n\n- The 6s expand in multiple directions.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the 5s are vertical, and they don't expand.\n\nThe 3s are horizontal and expand left.\n\nThe 2s are single rows and expand upwards.\n\nThe 6s expand to fill the area between 2s and 3s.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I need to think in terms of regions bounded by non-zero numbers.\n\nEach group of non-zero numbers defines a region, and within that region, the numbers expand to fill the space.\n\nBut I need a better way to model this.\n\nAnother idea: For each non-zero cell, propagate its value to adjacent zero cells until bounded by other non-zero cells.\n\nLike a flooding algorithm, where each non-zero group floods into zeros until it meets another non-zero group.\n\nIn this case, the flooding stops at the boundary of the next non-zero group.\n\nLet me try applying this to Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- The 8s are on top, expand downwards until they meet the 4s.\n\n- The 4s expand upwards to meet the 8s and downwards to meet the 3s.\n\n- The 3s expand upwards to meet the 4s.\n\n- The 5s are at the bottom and don't expand.\n\nThis seems consistent with a flooding approach where each group expands into zeros until it meets another group.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1:\n\n- The 5s are on the right, don't expand.\n\n- The 2s expand left until they meet the 7s.\n\n- The 3s expand right until they meet the 7s.\n\n- The 7s expand upwards.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 7s expand upwards, filling more rows.\n\nIs there a specific direction for expansion based on the position?\n\nWait, perhaps the expansion happens from the center of the group outward, filling zeros until bounded by other non-zero groups.\n\nBut I need a more precise rule.\n\nLet's consider the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n- Top row of 5s.\n\n- Several rows of 0s.\n\n- One row of 4s.\n\n- More rows of 0s.\n\n- One row with some 8s.\n\n- More rows of 0s.\n\n- One row of 2s.\n\n- More rows of 0s.\n\n- One row of 3s.\n\n- More rows of 0s.\n\nSo, I need to expand these groups into the zero areas.\n\nBased on the training examples, it seems that horizontal lines expand horizontally, and vertical lines expand vertically.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the 5s are vertical and don't expand.\n\nWait, maybe vertical lines don't expand, only horizontal lines do.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 4s are horizontal and expand vertically.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the expansion direction is perpendicular to the group's orientation.\n\n- Horizontal groups expand vertically.\n\n- Vertical groups expand horizontally.\n\nBut in Example 0, the 8s are horizontal and expand vertically.\n\nThe 4s are horizontal and expand vertically.\n\nThe 3s are horizontal and expand vertically.\n\nThe 5s are horizontal and don't expand.\n\nWait, but in the test input, the 5s are horizontal.\n\nWait, perhaps the expansion happens towards the direction of the nearest non-zero group.\n\nWait, I need a better approach.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of priority or order of expansion.\n\nAssuming that higher numbers have higher priority.\n\nWait, but numbers are just identifiers; their numerical value might not indicate priority.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion happens simultaneously, and the boundaries are where two expansions meet.\n\nLike pouring different colored liquids into a container and watching them meet at interfaces.\n\nIn computing terms, it's similar to region growing or watershed algorithms in image processing.\n\nBut I need to implement this in a simple, step-by-step manner.\n\nLet me try the following approach:\n\n1. Identify all distinct non-zero groups in the input.\n\n2. For each group, propagate its number into adjacent zero cells until encountering another non-zero group.\n\n3. Repeat this propagation for all groups simultaneously, effectively filling the zeros with the nearest non-zero group's number.\n\nThis sounds similar to a multi-source flooding algorithm, where each non-zero group is a source that floods into zeros.\n\nIn practice, this can be implemented using a breadth-first search (BFS) from each non-zero group, updating the zeros with the group's number until boundaries are met with other groups.\n\nLet's try applying this to Example 0.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- Groups: 8s (row 6), 4s (row 3), 3s (rows 12-14), 5s (row 15).\n\n- Propagate 8s downwards until meeting 4s.\n\n- Propagate 4s upwards to meet 8s and downwards to meet 3s.\n\n- Propagate 3s upwards to meet 4s.\n\n- 5s remain as they are, since they are at the bottom.\n\nThis matches the output of Example 0.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1:\n\n- Groups: 5s (rightmost column), 2s (rows 1-2), 3s (rows 5-7), 7s (rows 8-11).\n\n- Propagate 5s leftwards.\n\n- Propagate 2s leftwards to meet 7s.\n\n- Propagate 3s rightwards to meet 7s.\n\n- Propagate 7s upwards.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\n- Groups: 5s (vertical on the left), 3s (row 5), 2s (row 11), 6s (rows 6-7).\n\n- Propagate 5s rightwards.\n\n- Propagate 3s leftwards to meet 5s.\n\n- Propagate 2s upwards to meet 6s.\n\n- Propagate 6s in multiple directions.\n\nAgain, this matches the output.\n\nSo, this approach seems promising.\n\nNow, applying this to the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n\n- Top row: 5s (row 0).\n\n- Several rows of 0s.\n\n- Row 4: 4s.\n\n- More 0s.\n\n- Row 6: 8s.\n\n- More 0s.\n\n- Row 12: 2s.\n\n- More 0s.\n\n- Row 16: 3s.\n\n- More 0s.\n\nSo, the non-zero groups are:\n\n- 5s (row 0).\n\n- 4s (row 4).\n\n- 8s (row 6).\n\n- 2s (row 12).\n\n- 3s (row 16).\n\nI need to propagate these groups into the zero rows between them.\n\nLet's consider the spaces between the groups:\n\n- Between 5s and 4s: rows 1-3.\n\n- Between 4s and 8s: rows 5.\n\n- Between 8s and 2s: rows 7-11.\n\n- Between 2s and 3s: rows 13-15.\n\n- Below 3s: rows 17-18.\n\nI need to decide how to assign the numbers in these rows based on the neighboring groups.\n\nAccording to the flooding approach:\n\n- Propagate 5s downwards to meet the 4s.\n\n- Propagate 4s upwards to meet 5s and downwards to meet 8s.\n\n- Propagate 8s upwards to meet 4s and downwards to meet 2s.\n\n- Propagate 2s upwards to meet 8s and downwards to meet 3s.\n\n- Propagate 3s upwards to meet 2s.\n\n- The bottom rows remain as 0s since there are no other groups below.\n\nLet's assign the rows accordingly:\n\n- Rows 0-4: 5s propagate downwards.\n\n- Rows 4-6: 4s propagate upwards to meet 5s and downwards to meet 8s.\n\n- Rows 6-12: 8s propagate upwards to meet 4s and downwards to meet 2s.\n\n- Rows 12-16: 2s propagate upwards to meet 8s and downwards to meet 3s.\n\n- Rows 16-18: 3s propagate upwards to meet 2s.\n\nSo, in terms of which group occupies which rows:\n\n- Rows 0-4: 5s.\n\n- Rows 4-6: 4s.\n\n- Rows 6-12: 8s.\n\n- Rows 12-16: 2s.\n\n- Rows 16-18: 3s.\n\nWait, but in this assignment, there are overlapping rows where groups meet.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- Row 4: 4s and 5s meet.\n\n- Row 6: 8s and 4s meet.\n\n- Row 12: 2s and 8s meet.\n\n- Row 16: 3s and 2s meet.\n\nI need to define how the boundaries are handled.\n\nIn the flooding algorithm, the boundary is where the influence of two groups meets.\n\nPerhaps I can assign the rows based on which group is closer.\n\nBut in this grid, since it's a 2D grid, I need to consider both rows and columns.\n\nWait, but in this test input, all non-zero groups are horizontal lines in specific rows.\n\nSo, perhaps the expansion happens vertically, with each group expanding to cover the rows between them.\n\nIn that case:\n\n- 5s expand downwards to row 4.\n\n- 4s expand upwards to meet 5s and downwards to meet 8s.\n\n- 8s expand upwards to meet 4s and downwards to meet 2s.\n\n- 2s expand upwards to meet 8s and downwards to meet 3s.\n\n- 3s expand upwards to meet 2s.\n\nSo, in rows 1-3: 5s.\n\nRow 4: 4s.\n\nRow 5: 4s.\n\nRows 6-11: 8s.\n\nRows 12-15: 2s.\n\nRow 16: 3s.\n\nRow 17-18: 3s.\n\nWait, but in row 4, it's 4s, which is already defined.\n\nSo, the expansion would fill:\n\n- Rows 1-3: 5s.\n\n- Row 4: 4s.\n\n- Rows 5-11: 8s.\n\n- Rows 12-15: 2s.\n\n- Rows 16-18: 3s.\n\nBut in the original input, row 6 has some 8s and row 12 has 2s, etc.\n\nWait, but in the test input, row 5 has some 8s, but in my assignment, rows 6-11 should be 8s.\n\nWait, let's check the test input again.\n\nWait, in the test input:\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]\n\nRow 6: [4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nWait, row 5 has some 8s on the right.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted the rows.\n\nLet me re-examine the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\nRow 0: [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow 1: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8,0]\n\nRow 6: [4,4,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 7: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 8: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 9: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 10: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 11: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 12: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 13: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 14: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 15: [0,0,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 17: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 18: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOkay, so non-zero rows are:\n\n- Row 0: 5s\n\n- Row 5: partial 8s\n\n- Row 6: 4s\n\n- Row 11: partial 2s\n\n- Row 15: 3s\n\nSo, perhaps I need to adjust my earlier assumption.\n\nNow, considering this:\n\n- The 5s are on row 0.\n\n- The 4s are on row 6.\n\n- The 8s are on row 5.\n\n- The 2s are on row 11.\n\n- The 3s are on row 15.\n\nI need to propagate these groups into the zero rows between them.\n\nLet's consider the spaces:\n\n- Between 5s and 8s: rows 1-4.\n\n- Between 8s and 4s: row 5-6.\n\n- Between 4s and 2s: rows 7-10.\n\n- Between 2s and 3s: rows 12-14.\n\n- Below 3s: rows 16-18.\n\nSo, I need to assign the propagation accordingly.\n\nLet's try:\n\n- Propagate 5s downwards to meet the 8s.\n\n- Propagate 8s upwards to meet 5s and downwards to meet 4s.\n\n- Propagate 4s upwards to meet 8s and downwards to meet 2s.\n\n- Propagate 2s upwards to meet 4s and downwards to meet 3s.\n\n- Propagate 3s upwards to meet 2s.\n\nThis would mean:\n\n- Rows 1-4: 5s.\n\n- Rows 5-6: 8s.\n\n- Rows 7-10: 4s.\n\n- Rows 11-14: 2s.\n\n- Rows 15-18: 3s.\n\nBut in row 5, there are already some 8s present, so that seems consistent.\n\nSimilarly, in row 11, there are 2s present.\n\nSo, perhaps this is the way to go.\n\nLet me fill in the grid based on this:\n\nRows 0-4: 5s.\n\nRow 5: 8s (existing 8s, rest 0s).\n\nRow 6: 4s.\n\nRows 7-10: 4s.\n\nRow 11: 2s.\n\nRows 12-14: 2s.\n\nRow 15: 3s.\n\nRows 16-18: 3s.\n\nBut in the original input, row 5 has only partial 8s, and row 11 has partial 2s.\n\nSo, in the output, I need to expand these numbers to fill the rows.\n\nWait, but in the training examples, the expansion seems to respect the existing numbers and fills in the zeros accordingly.\n\nSo, in row 5, which has some 8s, I need to propagate the 8s to the left to fill the zeros until they meet the 5s above.\n\nSimilarly, in row 11, propagate the 2s to the left to fill until they meet the 4s above.\n\nWait, but in row 5, the 8s are on the right, so they should propagate leftwards to meet the 5s above.\n\nSimilarly, in row 11, the 2s are in the middle, so they should propagate leftwards and rightwards to fill the zeros.\n\nBut in row 5, there are only 8s on the right, so propagating left would fill the zeros to the left with 8s.\n\nSimilarly, in row 11, the 2s are in the middle, so propagating left and right would fill the zeros around them with 2s.\n\nWait, but in row 5, there are 8s at columns 14-16.\n\nSo, propagate 8s leftwards to fill columns 0-13 with 8s, meeting the 5s above.\n\nBut in row 5, the 8s are at columns 14-16, and the rest are 0s.\n\nSo, propagating 8s leftwards would fill columns 0-13 with 8s.\n\nBut in the rows above, rows 0-4 are 5s.\n\nSo, in row 5, columns 0-13: 5s, columns 14-16: 8s, column 17: 0.\n\nWait, but according to the flooding approach, the 5s would propagate downwards to meet the 8s in row 5.\n\nSimilarly, the 8s would propagate upwards to meet the 5s.\n\nSo, in row 5, the 5s and 8s would meet at some boundary.\n\nBut in the input, row 5 has only partial 8s on the right.\n\nSo, perhaps the 8s expand leftwards to meet the 5s.\n\nSimilarly, in row 11, the 2s expand leftwards and rightwards to fill the zeros.\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nLet me try to implement this step by step.\n\nFirst, identify all non-zero groups:\n\n- Row 0: 5s (columns 0-17).\n\n- Row 5: 8s (columns 14-16).\n\n- Row 6: 4s (columns 0-3).\n\n- Row 11: 2s (columns 7-11).\n\n- Row 15: 3s (columns 6-12).\n\nNow, propagate these groups into the zero areas.\n\nStarting with the 5s:\n\n- Propagate downwards from row 0 to row 4.\n\n- In row 5, propagate leftwards from the 8s to meet the 5s.\n\nWait, but the 8s are on the right in row 5.\n\nSo, the 8s should propagate leftwards to meet the 5s.\n\nSimilarly, the 5s propagate downwards to meet the 8s.\n\nSo, in row 5, the 5s and 8s meet.\n\nPerhaps the boundary is at the existing 8s in columns 14-16.\n\nSo, columns 0-13: 5s, columns 14-16: 8s.\n\nSimilarly, in row 6, the 4s are in columns 0-3.\n\nPropagate the 4s downwards to meet the 2s in row 11.\n\nWait, but there are zeros between row 6 and row 11.\n\nSo, propagate 4s downwards to row 11.\n\nBut row 11 has 2s in columns 7-11.\n\nSo, the 4s would propagate downwards until they meet the 2s.\n\nSimilarly, the 2s propagate upwards to meet the 4s.\n\nSo, in rows 7-10, fill with 4s.\n\nIn rows 12-14, fill with 2s.\n\nSimilarly, the 8s in row 5 propagate downwards to meet the 4s in row 6.\n\nWait, but row 6 has 4s in columns 0-3.\n\nSo, in row 5, columns 0-13: 5s, columns 14-16: 8s.\n\nIn row 6, columns 0-3: 4s, columns 4-13: 8s, columns 14-16: 8s.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to align the expansions properly.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated.\n\nMaybe I should think column-wise as well.\n\nLooking at columns:\n\n- Columns where non-zero numbers are present.\n\nFor example, in column 0:\n\n- Row 0: 5\n\n- Rows 1-4: 0\n\n- Row 5: 0\n\n- Row 6: 4\n\n- Rows 7-10: 0\n\n- Row 11: 0\n\n- Rows 12-14: 0\n\n- Row 15: 0\n\n- Rows 16-18: 0\n\nSo, in column 0:\n\n- 5s propagate downwards from row 0 to row 6.\n\n- In row 6, it meets the 4s.\n\nSo, rows 0-5: 5s, row 6: 4s, rows 7-18: 4s.\n\nWait, but in row 6, columns 4-13 are zeros, which should be filled with 4s.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to propagate each group's number into the zeros until it meets another group.\n\nIn other words, perform a flood fill from each non-zero group into the zeros.\n\nTo implement this, I can use a BFS approach starting from each non-zero cell.\n\nBut since this is a thought process, I'll try to simulate it mentally.\n\nFirst, mark all non-zero cells as sources.\n\nThen, propagate their values into adjacent zeros, level by level, until all zeros are filled.\n\nIn this way, each zero cell will take the value of the nearest non-zero neighbor.\n\nIn case of a tie, prioritize the group that reaches first.\n\nBut in practice, I need to ensure that different groups don't overwrite each other's expansions.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps I can accept that my current approach is sufficient and proceed to fill in the grid accordingly.\n\nSo, based on the earlier assignment:\n\n- Rows 0-4: 5s.\n\n- Row 5: 5s in columns 0-13, 8s in columns 14-16.\n\n- Row 6: 4s in columns 0-3, 8s in columns 4-13, 8s in columns 14-16.\n\n- Rows 7-10: 4s.\n\n- Row 11: 4s in columns 0-6, 2s in columns 7-11, 4s in columns 12-17.\n\n- Rows 12-14: 2s.\n\n- Row 15: 2s in columns 0-5, 3s in columns 6-12, 2s in columns 13-17.\n\n- Rows 16-18: 3s.\n\nThis is just a rough estimation, and may not be entirely accurate, but it's a start.\n\nNow, let's try to fill in the grid step by step.\n\nStarting with row 0:\n\n[5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]\n\nRow 1: Propagate 5s
