Raw model response:
I'm going to try to solve this puzzle. Let's look at the training examples to understand the pattern.

In Example 0:

Input:

[0, 3, 3, 3]

[0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0]

[2, 2, 2, 2]

[0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0]

[3, 3, 0, 0]

Output:

[0, 3, 3, 3]

[0, 4, 0, 0]

[0, 4, 0, 0]

[0, 4, 0, 0]

[2, 2, 2, 2]

[0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0]

[3, 3, 0, 0]

Hmm, it seems like some zeros have been replaced by 4s in the second to fourth rows, specifically in the second column.

In Example 1:

Input:

[0, 6, 6, 6, 6]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 6, 6, 6]

Output:

[0, 6, 6, 6, 6]

[0, 0, 4, 4, 4]

[0, 0, 4, 4, 4]

[0, 0, 4, 4, 4]

[0, 0, 4, 4, 4]

[0, 0, 4, 4, 4]

[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 6, 6, 6]

Here, in rows 2 to 7, columns 3 to 5 are replaced with 4s.

In Example 2:

Input:

[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

Output:

[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

[0, 4, 4, 0, 0]

[0, 4, 4, 0, 0]

[0, 4, 4, 0, 0]

[0, 4, 4, 0, 0]

[0, 4, 4, 0, 0]

[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

In this case, rows 8 to 12, columns 2 and 3 are replaced with 4s.

In Example 3:

Input:

[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Output:

[0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0]

[0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Here, rows 8 to 12, columns 4 and 5 are replaced with 4s.

From these examples, it seems like the transformation involves replacing certain zeros with 4s in a specific region of the grid. The region seems to be bounded by the non-zero values in the first and last rows.

Looking closer, it appears that in each example, there is a "sandwich" of rows between two rows that have non-zero values. The top row has some non-zero values, then there are several rows of zeros, and then another row with non-zero values. The transformation involves replacing the zeros in a specific area within these sandwiched rows with 4s.

In Example 0:

- Top row: [0, 3, 3, 3]

- Bottom row: [3, 3, 0, 0]

The area between them, specifically columns where the top and bottom rows have non-zero values, is filled with 4s.

Similarly, in Example 1:

- Top row: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6]

- Bottom row: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6]

The overlapping non-zero columns are columns 3, 4, 5, and zeros in rows 2-7, columns 3-5 are replaced with 4s.

In Example 2:

- Top row: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]

- Bottom row: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]

The overlapping non-zero columns are columns 1, 2, 4. But in the output, only columns 2 and 3 are filled with 4s in the sandwiched rows. Wait, this seems inconsistent at first glance.

Wait, in Example 2, the top row has non-zero values in columns 1 and 2, and the bottom row has non-zero values in columns 1, 2, 3, 4. The intersection (or overlapping non-zero columns) would be columns 1 and 2. However, in the output, columns 2 and 3 are filled with 4s. This seems inconsistent with the previous interpretation.

Wait, perhaps it's not just the intersection but also considering the spread.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the columns that have non-zero values in either the top or bottom row.

In Example 0:

Top: columns 1,2,3

Bottom: columns 0,1

Intersection: columns 1

But in the output, column 1 is filled with 4s.

Wait, but in Example 1:

Top: columns 1,2,3,4

Bottom: columns 2,3,4

Intersection: columns 2,3,4

In the output, columns 3,4,5 are filled with 4s. Wait, column indexing might be off by one.

Wait, perhaps it's columns where top or bottom have non-zero values.

In Example 0:

Top: columns 1,2,3

Bottom: columns 0,1

Union: columns 0,1,2,3

But in the output, only column 1 is filled with 4s.

This doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the columns where both top and bottom have non-zero values.

In Example 0:

Columns 1

In Example 1:

Columns 2,3,4

In Example 2:

Columns 1,2

In Example 3:

Columns 3,4

This seems to be the intersection of non-zero columns in the top and bottom rows.

Then, in the sandwiched rows, those columns are filled with 4s.

Wait, but in Example 2, columns 1 and 2 should be filled with 4s, but in the output, columns 2 and 3 are filled with 4s. There might be a misalignment.

Wait, perhaps it's considering the columns where top and bottom both have non-zero values, extended by the spread in the top and bottom rows.

Wait, maybe it's the columns where top has non-zero values OR bottom has non-zero values.

In Example 0:

Columns 0,1,2,3

In Example 1:

Columns 0,1,2,3,4

In Example 2:

Columns 0,1,2,3,4

In Example 3:

Columns 0,1,2,3,4,5

But in the outputs, only specific columns are filled with 4s.

Wait, maybe it's the columns where top has non-zero or bottom has non-zero, but not both.

Wait, no, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the columns where top has non-zero and bottom has zero, or vice versa.

In Example 0:

Top: 1,2,3

Bottom: 0,1

So, columns where top has non-zero and bottom has zero: columns 2,3

Columns where bottom has non-zero and top has zero: column 0

But in the output, only column 1 is filled with 4s.

This isn't adding up.

Wait, perhaps it's the columns where both top and bottom have non-zero values.

In Example 0:

Column 1

In Example 1:

Columns 2,3,4

In Example 2:

Columns 1

In Example 3:

Columns 3

But in Example 2, the output shows columns 2 and 3 filled with 4s, which doesn't match this hypothesis.

Wait, in Example 2:

Top: [0,1,1,0,0]

Bottom: [1,1,1,1,0]

Intersection: columns 1

But in the output, columns 2 and 3 are filled with 4s.

This suggests that it's not just the intersection.

Wait, perhaps it's the columns where top or bottom have non-zero values, excluding the edges.

Wait, I need a better approach.

Let me consider the positions where the top and bottom rows have non-zero values.

In Example 0:

Top: columns 1,2,3

Bottom: columns 0,1

Intersection: column 1

Union: columns 0,1,2,3

In the output, column 1 is filled with 4s in the sandwiched rows.

In Example 1:

Top: columns 1,2,3,4

Bottom: columns 2,3,4

Intersection: columns 2,3,4

In the output, columns 3,4,5 are filled with 4s.

Wait, column indexing might be off by one.

Wait, perhaps it's columns where top and bottom both have non-zero values, shifted by one.

Wait, in Example 2:

Top: columns 1,2

Bottom: columns 0,1,2,3

Intersection: columns 1,2

In the output, columns 2 and 3 are filled with 4s.

Similarly, in Example 3:

Top: columns 3,4

Bottom: columns 1,2,3,4,5

Intersection: columns 3,4

In the output, columns 4 and 5 are filled with 4s.

Wait, so in each case, the columns filled with 4s in the output are the intersection columns shifted by one to the right.

Wait, in Example 0:

Intersection: column 1

Output: column 1 filled with 4s

In Example 1:

Intersection: columns 2,3,4

Output: columns 3,4,5 filled with 4s

In Example 2:

Intersection: columns 1,2

Output: columns 2,3 filled with 4s

In Example 3:

Intersection: columns 3,4

Output: columns 4,5 filled with 4s

So, it seems like the columns to be filled with 4s are the intersection columns shifted by one to the right.

Wait, but in Example 0, intersection is column 1, and output is column 1.

This doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's the columns where top and bottom both have non-zero values, but considering the grid's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's based on the first and last non-zero columns in the top and bottom rows.

Wait, in Example 0:

Top: first non-zero column =1, last=3

Bottom: first=0, last=1

So, the range is from min(1,0)=0 to max(3,1)=3

In the output, column 1 is filled with 4s.

In Example 1:

Top: first=1, last=4

Bottom: first=2, last=4

Range: min=1, max=4

Output: columns 3,4,5 filled with 4s.

Wait, that doesn't align.

Wait, perhaps it's columns from the first non-zero column in the top row to the last non-zero column in the bottom row.

In Example 0:

Top first non-zero:1

Bottom last non-zero:1

So columns from 1 to 1 are filled with 4s.

In Example 1:

Top first non-zero:1

Bottom last non-zero:4

So columns from 1 to 4 are filled with 4s, but in the output, columns 3,4,5 are filled with 4s.

This doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's columns from the first non-zero column in the bottom row to the last non-zero column in the top row.

In Example 0:

Bottom first non-zero:0

Top last non-zero:3

So columns from 0 to 3, but only column 1 is filled with 4s.

Doesn't match.

In Example 1:

Bottom first non-zero:2

Top last non-zero:4

Columns from 2 to 4 are filled with 4s.

But in the output, columns 3,4,5 are filled with 4s.

Still not matching directly.

Wait, perhaps there is a offset based on the size of the grid.

Wait, maybe it's relative to the center of the grid.

Wait, I need a different approach.

Let me look at the test input:

[7, 7, 7, 7, 7]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 7, 7, 0, 0]

Top row: [7,7,7,7,7]

Bottom row: [0,7,7,0,0]

The non-zero columns in the top row are 0,1,2,3,4

In the bottom row: 1,2

Intersection: columns 1,2

So, perhaps in the sandwiched rows, columns 1 and 2 are filled with 4s.

But looking back at Example 2:

Top: columns 1,2

Bottom: columns 0,1,2,3

Intersection: columns 1,2

Output: columns 2,3 filled with 4s.

This doesn't match the direct intersection.

Wait, perhaps it's columns where either top or bottom have non-zero values.

In Example 2:

Union: columns 0,1,2,3

But in the output, only columns 2,3 are filled with 4s.

 Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the columns where top has non-zero and bottom has zero, or vice versa.

In Example 0:

Top:1,2,3

Bottom:0,1

So, top has 2,3 (bottom has zero there)

Bottom has 0 (top has zero there)

So columns 0,2,3

But in the output, only column 1 is filled with 4s.

This isn't making sense.

Wait, maybe it's the columns where top and bottom both have zero.

In Example 0:

Top:0,1,2,3

Bottom:0,1

Columns where both have zero: none

But in the output, column 1 is filled with 4s.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the columns where top has non-zero or bottom has non-zero.

In Example 0:

Columns 0,1,2,3

Output: column 1 filled with 4s.

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe it's based on the number of non-zero elements in the top and bottom rows.

In Example 0:

Top has 3 non-zero elements, bottom has 2.

Output has 1 column filled with 4s.

In Example 1:

Top has 4 non-zero, bottom has 3.

Output has 3 columns filled with 4s.

In Example 2:

Top has 2 non-zero, bottom has 4.

Output has 2 columns filled with 4s.

In Example 3:

Top has 2 non-zero, bottom has 4.

Output has 2 columns filled with 4s.

Not a clear pattern here.

Wait, maybe it's based on the number of non-zero columns in the top and bottom rows.

In Example 0:

Top:3, bottom:2 → min(3,2)=2 → output has 1 column filled

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of consecutive non-zero columns from the left in both top and bottom.

In Example 0:

Top: columns 1,2,3

Bottom: columns 0,1

Consecutive from the left: only column 1

Output: column 1 filled with 4s.

In Example 1:

Top: columns 1,2,3,4

Bottom: columns 2,3,4

Consecutive from the left: columns 2,3,4

Output: columns 3,4,5 filled with 4s.

Wait, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's shifted by the number of common consecutive columns.

In Example 0:

Common consecutive from the left: column 1

Output: column 1 filled

In Example 1:

Common consecutive from the left: columns 2,3,4

Output: columns 3,4,5 filled

In Example 2:

Top:1,2

Bottom:0,1,2,3

Common consecutive from the left: column 1

Output: columns 2,3 filled

In Example 3:

Top:3,4

Bottom:1,2,3,4,5

Common consecutive from the left: columns 3,4

Output: columns 4,5 filled

Yes, this seems to be a pattern.

So, the number of columns filled with 4s is equal to the number of common consecutive columns from the left in the top and bottom rows, but shifted by one column to the right.

In Example 0:

Common consecutive: column 1 → fill column 1

In Example 1:

Common consecutive: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5

In Example 2:

Common consecutive: column 1 → fill columns 2,3

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in Example 2:

Common consecutive from the left: column 1

Then, fill columns starting from column 2 for the number of common consecutive columns.

Wait, in Example 2, common consecutive is column 1, so fill 1 column starting from column 2: columns 2

But in the output, columns 2 and 3 are filled.

Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe fill columns starting from the next column after the common consecutive columns.

In Example 0:

Common consecutive: column 1 → fill column 1

In Example 1:

Common consecutive: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5

In Example 2:

Common consecutive: column 1 → fill columns 2,3

In Example 3:

Common consecutive: columns 3,4 → fill columns 4,5

So, it's filling the number of columns equal to the number of common consecutive columns from the left, starting from the next column after the last common consecutive column.

In Example 0:

Common consecutive: column 1 → fill column 1 (since only one column, fill that column)

In Example 1:

Common consecutive: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5 (starting from column 3)

In Example 2:

Common consecutive: column 1 → fill columns 2,3 (starting from column 2, fill 2 columns)

Wait, but why 2 columns in Example 2?

Wait, maybe the number of columns to fill is equal to the number of common consecutive columns plus one.

In Example 0:

1 common consecutive column → fill 1 column

In Example 1:

3 common consecutive columns → fill 3 columns

In Example 2:

1 common consecutive column → fill 2 columns

In Example 3:

2 common consecutive columns → fill 2 columns

Doesn't seem consistent.

Wait, perhaps it's based on the number of common columns, not necessarily consecutive.

In Example 0:

Intersection: column 1 → fill column 1

In Example 1:

Intersection: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5

In Example 2:

Intersection: columns 1,2 → fill columns 2,3

In Example 3:

Intersection: columns 3,4 → fill columns 4,5

So, it's filling the columns immediately to the right of the intersection columns.

In Example 0:

Intersection: column 1 → fill column 1

(Perhaps an exception when intersection starts from column 1)

In Example 1:

Intersection: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5

In Example 2:

Intersection: columns 1,2 → fill columns 2,3

In Example 3:

Intersection: columns 3,4 → fill columns 4,5

So, it's filling the columns that are one column to the right of the intersection columns.

But in Example 0, it fills column 1, which doesn't follow this rule.

Wait, perhaps it's filling the columns that are in the intersection plus one column to the right.

In Example 0:

Intersection: column 1 → fill column 1

In Example 1:

Intersection: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5

In Example 2:

Intersection: columns 1,2 → fill columns 2,3

In Example 3:

Intersection: columns 3,4 → fill columns 4,5

So, for each column in the intersection, fill that column plus one column to the right.

In Example 0:

Column 1 → fill column 1 and column 2

But in the output, only column 1 is filled.

This might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps it's filling the columns that are in the intersection and the column immediately to the right of the intersection.

In Example 0:

Intersection: column 1 → fill column 1 and column 2

But in the output, only column 1 is filled.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's based on the number of common columns.

In Example 0:

1 common column → fill 1 column

In Example 1:

3 common columns → fill 3 columns

In Example 2:

2 common columns → fill 2 columns

In Example 3:

2 common columns → fill 2 columns

So, fill the number of columns equal to the number of common columns, starting from the first column after the intersection.

In Example 0:

Intersection: column 1 → fill column 1

In Example 1:

Intersection: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5

In Example 2:

Intersection: columns 1,2 → fill columns 2,3

In Example 3:

Intersection: columns 3,4 → fill columns 4,5

Yes, this seems consistent.

So, the rule is:

- Find the columns where both the top and bottom rows have non-zero values (intersection columns).

- Fill with 4s the same number of columns, starting from the column immediately after the first intersection column.

- If the starting column is beyond the grid's columns, fill from the first column.

Wait, in Example 0:

Intersection: column 1 → start filling from column 2, but in the output, column 1 is filled.

This doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe in Example 0, the starting column is column 1 +1 =2, but since column 2 is already part of the intersection, fill column 1 instead.

This is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's filling the columns that are in the intersection and the columns to the right of them, up to the number of intersection columns.

In Example 0:

Intersection: column 1 → fill column 1

In Example 1:

Intersection: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5

In Example 2:

Intersection: columns 1,2 → fill columns 2,3

In Example 3:

Intersection: columns 3,4 → fill columns 4,5

Yes, this seems to be the pattern.

So, for the test input:

Top row: [7,7,7,7,7] → columns 0,1,2,3,4

Bottom row: [0,7,7,0,0] → columns 1,2

Intersection: columns 1,2

Number of intersection columns: 2

Start filling from column 2 (which is column immediately after the first intersection column)

Fill columns 2 and 3 with 4s in the sandwiched rows.

So, in the test input, the sandwiched rows are rows 2 to 6.

Therefore, in rows 2 to 6, columns 2 and 3 should be filled with 4s.

Let's confirm with the training examples.

In Example 2:

Intersection: columns 1,2

Fill columns 2 and 3

In Example 3:

Intersection: columns 3,4

Fill columns 4 and 5

Yes, this matches.

So, applying this to the test input:

[7, 7, 7, 7, 7]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

[0, 7, 7, 0, 0]

We need to fill columns 2 and 3 in rows 2 to 6 with 4s.

So, the output should be:

[7,7,7,7,7]

[0,0,4,4,0]

[0,0,4,4,0]

[0,0,4,4,0]

[0,0,4,4,0]

[2,2,2,2,2]

[0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0]

[0,0,0,0,0]

[0,7,7,0,0]

Now, to represent this as a JSON array, we need to flatten the 2D array into a 1D array.

Assuming the grid is read row by row, the output should be:

[7,7,7,7,7,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0]

But to confirm, let's count the number of elements.

Each row has 5 elements, and there are 11 rows, so total elements: 55.

Yes, the above array has 55 elements.

So, the final output is:

The region seems to be bounded by the non-zero values in the first and last rows.\n\nLooking closer, it appears that in each example, there is a "sandwich" of rows between two rows that have non-zero values. The top row has some non-zero values, then there are several rows of zeros, and then another row with non-zero values. The transformation involves replacing the zeros in a specific area within these sandwiched rows with 4s.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n- Top row: [0, 3, 3, 3]\n\n- Bottom row: [3, 3, 0, 0]\n\nThe area between them, specifically columns where the top and bottom rows have non-zero values, is filled with 4s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1:\n\n- Top row: [0, 6, 6, 6, 6]\n\n- Bottom row: [0, 0, 6, 6, 6]\n\nThe overlapping non-zero columns are columns 3, 4, 5, and zeros in rows 2-7, columns 3-5 are replaced with 4s.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\n- Top row: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n\n- Bottom row: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nThe overlapping non-zero columns are columns 1, 2, 4. But in the output, only columns 2 and 3 are filled with 4s in the sandwiched rows. Wait, this seems inconsistent at first glance.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the top row has non-zero values in columns 1 and 2, and the bottom row has non-zero values in columns 1, 2, 3, 4. The intersection (or overlapping non-zero columns) would be columns 1 and 2. However, in the output, columns 2 and 3 are filled with 4s. This seems inconsistent with the previous interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s not just the intersection but also considering the spread.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s better to think in terms of the columns that have non-zero values in either the top or bottom row.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nTop: columns 1,2,3\n\nBottom: columns 0,1\n\nIntersection: columns 1\n\nBut in the output, column 1 is filled with 4s.\n\nWait, but in Example 1:\n\nTop: columns 1,2,3,4\n\nBottom: columns 2,3,4\n\nIntersection: columns 2,3,4\n\nIn the output, columns 3,4,5 are filled with 4s. Wait, column indexing might be off by one.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s columns where top or bottom have non-zero values.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nTop: columns 1,2,3\n\nBottom: columns 0,1\n\nUnion: columns 0,1,2,3\n\nBut in the output, only column 1 is filled with 4s.\n\nThis doesn\'t match.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s the columns where both top and bottom have non-zero values.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nColumns 1\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nColumns 2,3,4\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nColumns 1,2\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nColumns 3,4\n\nThis seems to be the intersection of non-zero columns in the top and bottom rows.\n\nThen, in the sandwiched rows, those columns are filled with 4s.\n\nWait, but in Example 2, columns 1 and 2 should be filled with 4s, but in the output, columns 2 and 3 are filled with 4s. There might be a misalignment.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s considering the columns where top and bottom both have non-zero values, extended by the spread in the top and bottom rows.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s the columns where top has non-zero values OR bottom has non-zero values.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nColumns 0,1,2,3\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nColumns 0,1,2,3,4\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nColumns 0,1,2,3,4\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nColumns 0,1,2,3,4,5\n\nBut in the outputs, only specific columns are filled with 4s.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s the columns where top has non-zero or bottom has non-zero, but not both.\n\nWait, no, that doesn\'t match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s the columns where top has non-zero and bottom has zero, or vice versa.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nTop: 1,2,3\n\nBottom: 0,1\n\nSo, columns where top has non-zero and bottom has zero: columns 2,3\n\nColumns where bottom has non-zero and top has zero: column 0\n\nBut in the output, only column 1 is filled with 4s.\n\nThis isn\'t adding up.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s the columns where both top and bottom have non-zero values.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nColumn 1\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nColumns 2,3,4\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nColumns 1\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nColumns 3\n\nBut in Example 2, the output shows columns 2 and 3 filled with 4s, which doesn\'t match this hypothesis.\n\nWait, in Example 2:\n\nTop: [0,1,1,0,0]\n\nBottom: [1,1,1,1,0]\n\nIntersection: columns 1\n\nBut in the output, columns 2 and 3 are filled with 4s.\n\nThis suggests that it\'s not just the intersection.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s the columns where top or bottom have non-zero values, excluding the edges.\n\nWait, I need a better approach.\n\nLet me consider the positions where the top and bottom rows have non-zero values.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nTop: columns 1,2,3\n\nBottom: columns 0,1\n\nIntersection: column 1\n\nUnion: columns 0,1,2,3\n\nIn the output, column 1 is filled with 4s in the sandwiched rows.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nTop: columns 1,2,3,4\n\nBottom: columns 2,3,4\n\nIntersection: columns 2,3,4\n\nIn the output, columns 3,4,5 are filled with 4s.\n\nWait, column indexing might be off by one.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s columns where top and bottom both have non-zero values, shifted by one.\n\nWait, in Example 2:\n\nTop: columns 1,2\n\nBottom: columns 0,1,2,3\n\nIntersection: columns 1,2\n\nIn the output, columns 2 and 3 are filled with 4s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3:\n\nTop: columns 3,4\n\nBottom: columns 1,2,3,4,5\n\nIntersection: columns 3,4\n\nIn the output, columns 4 and 5 are filled with 4s.\n\nWait, so in each case, the columns filled with 4s in the output are the intersection columns shifted by one to the right.\n\nWait, in Example 0:\n\nIntersection: column 1\n\nOutput: column 1 filled with 4s\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nIntersection: columns 2,3,4\n\nOutput: columns 3,4,5 filled with 4s\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nIntersection: columns 1,2\n\nOutput: columns 2,3 filled with 4s\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nIntersection: columns 3,4\n\nOutput: columns 4,5 filled with 4s\n\nSo, it seems like the columns to be filled with 4s are the intersection columns shifted by one to the right.\n\nWait, but in Example 0, intersection is column 1, and output is column 1.\n\nThis doesn\'t fit.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s the columns where top and bottom both have non-zero values, but considering the grid\'s structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s based on the first and last non-zero columns in the top and bottom rows.\n\nWait, in Example 0:\n\nTop: first non-zero column =1, last=3\n\nBottom: first=0, last=1\n\nSo, the range is from min(1,0)=0 to max(3,1)=3\n\nIn the output, column 1 is filled with 4s.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nTop: first=1, last=4\n\nBottom: first=2, last=4\n\nRange: min=1, max=4\n\nOutput: columns 3,4,5 filled with 4s.\n\nWait, that doesn\'t align.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s columns from the first non-zero column in the top row to the last non-zero column in the bottom row.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nTop first non-zero:1\n\nBottom last non-zero:1\n\nSo columns from 1 to 1 are filled with 4s.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nTop first non-zero:1\n\nBottom last non-zero:4\n\nSo columns from 1 to 4 are filled with 4s, but in the output, columns 3,4,5 are filled with 4s.\n\nThis doesn\'t match.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s columns from the first non-zero column in the bottom row to the last non-zero column in the top row.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nBottom first non-zero:0\n\nTop last non-zero:3\n\nSo columns from 0 to 3, but only column 1 is filled with 4s.\n\nDoesn\'t match.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nBottom first non-zero:2\n\nTop last non-zero:4\n\nColumns from 2 to 4 are filled with 4s.\n\nBut in the output, columns 3,4,5 are filled with 4s.\n\nStill not matching directly.\n\nWait, perhaps there is a offset based on the size of the grid.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s relative to the center of the grid.\n\nWait, I need a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the test input:\n\n[7, 7, 7, 7, 7]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nTop row: [7,7,7,7,7]\n\nBottom row: [0,7,7,0,0]\n\nThe non-zero columns in the top row are 0,1,2,3,4\n\nIn the bottom row: 1,2\n\nIntersection: columns 1,2\n\nSo, perhaps in the sandwiched rows, columns 1 and 2 are filled with 4s.\n\nBut looking back at Example 2:\n\nTop: columns 1,2\n\nBottom: columns 0,1,2,3\n\nIntersection: columns 1,2\n\nOutput: columns 2,3 filled with 4s.\n\nThis doesn\'t match the direct intersection.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s columns where either top or bottom have non-zero values.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nUnion: columns 0,1,2,3\n\nBut in the output, only columns 2,3 are filled with 4s.\n\n Doesn\'t match.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s the columns where top has non-zero and bottom has zero, or vice versa.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nTop:1,2,3\n\nBottom:0,1\n\nSo, top has 2,3 (bottom has zero there)\n\nBottom has 0 (top has zero there)\n\nSo columns 0,2,3\n\nBut in the output, only column 1 is filled with 4s.\n\nThis isn\'t making sense.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s the columns where top and bottom both have zero.\n\nIn Example

bottom has non-zero.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nColumns 0,1,2,3\n\nOutput: column 1 filled with 4s.\n\nStill not matching.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s based on the number of non-zero elements in the top and bottom

4s.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nTop has 2 non-zero, bottom has 4.\n\nOutput has 2 columns filled with 4s.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nTop has 2 non-zero, bottom has 4.\n\nOutput has 2 columns filled with 4s.\n\nNot a clear pattern here.\n\nWait, maybe it\'s based on the number of non-zero columns in the top and bottom rows.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nTop:3, bottom:2 → min(3,2)=2 → output has 1 column filled\n\nWait, doesn\'t match.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s the number of consecutive non-zero columns from the left in both top and bottom.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nTop: columns 1,2,3\n\nBottom: columns 0,1\n\nConsecutive from the left: only column 1\n\nOutput: column 1 filled with 4s.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nTop: columns 1,2,3,4\n\nBottom: columns 2,3,4\n\nConsecutive from the left: columns 2,3,4\n\nOutput: columns 3,4,5 filled with 4s.\n\nWait, not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s shifted by the number of common consecutive columns.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nCommon consecutive from the left: column 1\n\nOutput: column 1 filled\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nCommon consecutive from the left: columns 2,3,4\n\nOutput: columns 3,4,5 filled\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nTop:1,2\n\nBottom:0,1,2,3\n\nCommon consecutive from the left: column 1\n\nOutput: columns 2,3 filled\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nTop:3,4\n\nBottom:1,2,3,4,5\n\nCommon consecutive from the left: columns 3,4\n\nOutput: columns 4,5 filled\n\nYes, this seems to be a pattern.\n\nSo, the number of columns filled with 4s is equal to the number of common consecutive columns from the left in the top and bottom rows, but shifted by one column to the right.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nCommon consecutive: column 1 → fill column 1\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nCommon consecutive: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nCommon consecutive: column 1 → fill columns 2,3\n\nWait, that doesn\'t match.\n\nWait, in Example 2:\n\nCommon consecutive from the left: column 1\n\nThen, fill columns starting from column 2 for the number of common consecutive columns.\n\nWait, in Example 2, common consecutive is column 1, so fill 1 column starting from column 2: columns 2\n\nBut in the output, columns 2 and 3 are filled.\n\nDoesn\'t match.\n\nWait, maybe fill columns starting from the next column after the common consecutive columns.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nCommon consecutive: column 1 → fill column 1\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nCommon consecutive: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nCommon consecutive: column 1 → fill columns 2,3\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nCommon consecutive: columns 3,4 → fill columns 4,5\n\nSo, it\'s filling the number of columns equal to the number of common consecutive columns from the left, starting from the next column after the last common consecutive column.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nCommon consecutive: column 1 → fill column 1 (since only one column, fill that column)\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nCommon consecutive: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5 (starting from column 3)\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nCommon consecutive: column 1 → fill columns 2,3 (starting from column 2, fill 2 columns)\n\nWait, but why 2 columns in Example 2?\n\nWait, maybe the number of columns to fill is equal to the number of common consecutive columns plus one.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n1 common consecutive column → fill 1 column\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n3 common consecutive columns → fill 3 columns\n\nIn Example 2:\n\n1 common consecutive column → fill 2 columns\n\nIn Example 3:\n\n2 common consecutive columns → fill 2 columns\n\nDoesn\'t seem consistent.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s based on the number of common columns, not necessarily consecutive.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nIntersection: column 1 → fill column 1\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nIntersection: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nIntersection: columns 1,2 → fill columns 2,3\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nIntersection: columns 3,4 → fill columns 4,5\n\nSo, it\'s filling the columns immediately to the right of the intersection columns.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nIntersection: column 1 → fill column 1\n\n(Perhaps an exception when intersection starts from column 1)\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nIntersection: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nIntersection: columns 1,2 → fill columns 2,3\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nIntersection: columns 3,4 → fill columns 4,5\n\nSo, it\'s filling the columns that are one column to the right of the intersection columns.\n\nBut in Example 0, it fills column 1, which doesn\'t follow this rule.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s filling the columns that are in the intersection plus one column to the right.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nIntersection: column 1 → fill column 1\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nIntersection: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nIntersection: columns 1,2 → fill columns 2,3\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nIntersection: columns 3,4 → fill columns 4,5\n\nSo, for each column in the intersection, fill that column plus one column to the right.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nColumn 1 → fill column 1 and column 2\n\nBut in the output, only column 1 is filled.\n\nThis might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s filling the columns that are in the intersection and the column immediately to the right of the intersection.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nIntersection: column 1 → fill column 1 and column 2\n\nBut in the output, only column 1 is filled.\n\nDoesn\'t match.\n\nWait, perhaps it\'s based on the number of common columns.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\n1 common column → fill 1 column\n\nIn Example 1:\n\n3 common columns → fill 3 columns\n\nIn Example 2:\n\n2 common columns → fill 2 columns\n\nIn Example 3:\n\n2 common columns → fill 2 columns\n\nSo, fill the number of columns equal to the number of common columns, starting from the first column after the intersection.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nIntersection: column 1 → fill column 1\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nIntersection: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nIntersection: columns 1,2 → fill columns 2,3\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nIntersection: columns 3,4 → fill columns 4,5\n\nYes, this seems consistent.\n\nSo, the rule is:\n\n- Find the columns where both the top and bottom rows have non-zero values (intersection columns).\n\n- Fill with 4s the same number of columns, starting from the column immediately after the first intersection column.\n\n- If the starting column is beyond the grid\'s columns, fill from the first column.\n\nWait, in Example 0:\n\nIntersection: column 1 → start filling from column 2, but in the output, column 1 is filled.\n\nThis doesn\'t fit.\n\nWait, maybe in Example 0, the starting column is column 1 +1 =2, but since column 2 is already part of the intersection, fill column 1 instead.\n\nThis is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s filling the columns that are in the intersection and the columns to the right of them, up to the number of intersection columns.\n\nIn Example 0:\n\nIntersection: column 1 → fill column 1\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nIntersection: columns 2,3,4 → fill columns 3,4,5\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nIntersection: columns 1,2 → fill columns 2,3\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nIntersection: columns 3,4 → fill columns 4,5\n\nYes, this seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo, for the test input:\n\nTop row: [7,7,7,7,7] → columns 0,1,2,3,4\n\nBottom row: [0,7,7,0,0] → columns 1,2\n\nIntersection: columns 1,2\n\nNumber of intersection columns: 2\n\nStart filling from column 2 (which is column immediately after the first intersection column)\n\nFill columns 2 and 3 with 4s in the sandwiched rows.\n\nSo, in the test input, the sandwiched rows are rows 2 to 6.\n\nTherefore, in rows 2 to 6, columns 2 and 3 should be filled with 4s.\n\nLet\'s confirm with the training examples.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nIntersection: columns 1,2\n\nFill columns 2 and 3\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nIntersection: columns 3,4\n\nFill columns 4 and 5\n\nYes, this matches.\n\nSo, applying this to the test input:\n\n[7, 7, 7, 7, 7]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n[0, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nWe need to fill columns 2 and 3 in rows 2 to 6 with 4s.\n\nSo, the output should be:\n\n[7,7,7,7,7]\n\n[0,0,4,4,0]\n\n[0,0,4,4,0]\n\n[0,0,4,4,0]\n\n[0,0,4,4,0]\n\n[2,2,2,2,2]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,0,0,0,0]\n\n[0,7,7,0,0]\n\nNow, to represent this as a JSON array, we need to flatten the 2D array into a 1D array.\n\nAssuming the grid is read row by row, the output should be:\n\n[7,7,7,7,7,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0]\n\nBut to confirm, let\'s count the number of elements.\n\nEach row has 5 elements, and there are 11 rows, so total elements: 55.\n\nYes, the above array has 55 elements.\n\nSo, the final output is:\n\n[7,7,7,7,7,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,4,4,0,2,2,2,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,7,0,0]', 'final_json': None, 'retries': 0, 'task_id': '20241222_225415'}
